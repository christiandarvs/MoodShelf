The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and once girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games.

Les Misérables,"Victor Hugo, Lee Fahnestock (Translator), Norman MacAfee (Translator)",4.18,"Introducing one of the most famous characters in literature, Jean Valjean—the noble peasant imprisoned for stealing a loaf of bread—Les Misérables ranks among the greatest novels of all time. In it, Victor Hugo takes readers deep into the Parisian underworld, immerses them in a battle between good and evil, and carries them to the barricades during the uprising of 1832 with a breathtaking realism that is unsurpassed in modern prose. Within his dramatic story are themes that capture the intellect and the emotions: crime and punishment, the relentless persecution of Valjean by Inspector Javert, the desperation of the prostitute Fantine, the amorality of the rogue Thénardier, and the universal desire to escape the prisons of our own minds. Les Misérables gave Victor Hugo a canvas upon which he portrayed his criticism of the French political and judicial systems, but the portrait that resulted is larger than life, epic in scope—an extravagant spectacle that dazzles the senses even as it touches the heart.Les MisérablesVictor Hugo, Lee Fahnestock (Translator), Norman MacAfee (Translator)Les MisérablesVictor Hugo, Lee Fahnestock (Translator), Norman MacAfee (Translator)",English,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'France', 'Historical', 'Novels', 'French Literature', 'Romance', 'Classic Literature']",1463,Signet Classics,03/03/87,682793,93.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1411852091l/24280.jpg,introducing one famous characters literature jean valjeanthe noble peasant imprisoned stealing loaf breadles misrables ranks among greatest novels time victor hugo takes readers deep parisian underworld immerses battle good evil carries barricades uprising breathtaking realism unsurpassed modern prose within dramatic story themes capture intellect emotions crime punishment relentless persecution valjean inspector javert desperation prostitute fantine amorality rogue thnardier universal desire escape prisons minds les misrables gave victor hugo canvas upon portrayed criticism french political judicial systems portrait resulted larger life epic scopean extravagant spectacle dazzles senses even touches heartles misrablesvictor hugo lee fahnestock translator norman macafee translatorles misrablesvictor hugo lee fahnestock translator norman macafee translator

It's also her first encounter with Jace, a Shadowhunter who looks a little like an angel and acts a lot like a jerk. Within twenty-four hours Clary is pulled into Jace's world with a vengeance when her mother disappears and Clary herself is attacked by a demon.

Ender's Game,"Orson Scott Card, Stefan Rudnicki (Narrator), Harlan Ellison (Narrator)",4.3,"Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin thinks he is playing computer simulated war games; he is, in fact, engaged in something far more desperate. The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.Source: hatrack.comEnder's GameOrson Scott Card, Stefan Rudnicki (Narrator), Harlan Ellison (Narrator)Ender's Saga #1Ender's GameOrson Scott Card, Stefan Rudnicki (Narrator), Harlan Ellison (Narrator)Ender's Saga #1",English,"['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Dystopia', 'War', 'Audiobook', 'Adventure']",324,Macmillan Audio,09/30/04,1131303,95.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1408303130l/375802.jpg,andrew ender wiggin thinks playing computer simulated war games fact engaged something far desperate result genetic experimentation ender may military genius earth desperately needs war alien enemy seeking destroy human life way find throw ender ever harsher training chip away find diamond inside destroy utterly ender wiggin six years old begins grow fastbut ender result experiment war buggers raging hundred years quest perfect general underway almost long enders two older siblings peter valentine every bit unusual different ways peter uncontrollably violent valentine nearly lacks capability violence altogether neither found suitable militarys purpose driven jealousy ender inbred drive power peter seeks control political process become ruler valentines abilities turn toward subtle control beliefs commoner elite alike powerfully convincing essays hiding youth identities behind anonymity computer networks two begin working together shape destiny earthan earth future brother ender failssource hatrackcomenders gameorson scott card stefan rudnicki narrator harlan ellison narratorenders saga enders gameorson scott card stefan rudnicki narrator harlan ellison narratorenders saga
The Help,Kathryn Stockett (Goodreads Author),4.47,"Librarian's note: An alternate cover edition can be found hereThree ordinary women are about to take one extraordinary step.Twenty-two-year-old Skeeter has just returned home after graduating from Ole Miss. She may have a degree, but it is 1962, Mississippi, and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone.Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.Minny, Aibileen's best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody's business, but she can't mind her tongue, so she's lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women, mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends, view one another. A deeply moving novel filled with poignancy, humor, and hope, The Help is a timeless and universal story about the lines we abide by, and the ones we don't.

The Secret Garden,Frances Hodgson Burnett,4.13,"""One of the most delightful and enduring classics of children's literature, The Secret Garden by Victorian author Frances Hodgson Burnett has remained a firm favorite with children the world over ever since it made its first appearance. Initially published as a serial story in 1910 in The American Magazine, it was brought out in novel form in 1911.  The plot centers round Mary Lennox, a young English girl who returns to England from India, having suffered the immense trauma by losing both her parents in a cholera epidemic. However, her memories of her parents are not pleasant, as they were a selfish, neglectful and pleasure-seeking couple. Mary is given to the care of her uncle Archibald Craven, whom she has never met. She travels to his home, Misselthwaite Manor located in the gloomy Yorkshire, a vast change from the sunny and warm climate she was used to. When she arrives, she is a rude, stubborn and given to stormy temper tantrums. However, her nature undergoes a gradual transformation when she learns of the tragedies that have befallen her strict and disciplinarian uncle whom she earlier feared and despised. Once when he's away from home, Mary discovers a charming walled garden which is always kept locked. The mystery deepens when she hears sounds of sobbing from somewhere within her uncle's vast mansion. The kindly servants ignore her queries or pretend they haven't heard, spiking Mary's curiosity.  The Secret Garden appeals to both young and old alike. It has wonderful elements of mystery, spirituality, charming characters and an authentic rendering of childhood emotions and experiences. Commonsense, truth and kindness, compassion and a belief in the essential goodness of human beings lie at the heart of this unforgettable story. It is the best known of Frances Hodgson Burnett's works, though most of us have definitely heard of, if not read, her other novel Little Lord Fauntleroy.  The book has been adapted extensively on stage, film and television and translated into all the world's major languages. In 1991, a Japanese anime version was launched for television in Japan. It remains a popular and beloved story of a child's journey into maturity, and a must-read for every child, parent, teacher and anyone who would enjoy this fascinating glimpse of childhood.

A Game of Thrones,George R.R. Martin,4.45,"Here is the first volume in George R. R. Martin’s magnificent cycle of novels that includes A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords. As a whole, this series comprises a genuine masterpiece of modern fantasy, bringing together the best the genre has to offer. Magic, mystery, intrigue, romance, and adventure fill these pages and transport us to a world unlike any we have ever experienced. Already hailed as a classic, George R. R. Martin’s stunning series is destined to stand as one of the great achievements of imaginative fiction.A GAME OF THRONESLong ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister and supernatural forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the land they were born to. Sweeping from a land of brutal cold to a distant summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, here is a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens.Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; and a determined woman undertakes the most treacherous of journeys.

The Outsiders,S.E. Hinton (Goodreads Author),4.1,"The Outsiders is about two weeks in the life of a 14-year-old boy. The novel tells the story of Ponyboy Curtis and his struggles with right and wrong in a society in which he believes that he is an outsider. According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for ""social"") has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he's always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy's skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser.Librarian note: This record is for one of the three editions published with different covers and with ISBN 0-140-38572-X / 978-0-14-038572-4.

The Pillars of the Earth,Ken Follett (Goodreads Author),4.31,"Ken Follett is known worldwide as the master of split-second suspense, but his most beloved and bestselling book tells the magnificent tale of a twelfth-century monk driven to do the seemingly impossible: build the greatest Gothic cathedral the world has ever known.Everything readers expect from Follett is here: intrigue, fast-paced action, and passionate romance. But what makes The Pillars of the Earth extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.For the Movie tie-in edition with the same ISBN go to this Alternate Cover EditionThe Pillars of the EarthKen Follett (Goodreads Author)Kingsbridge #1The Pillars of the EarthKen Follett (Goodreads Author)Kingsbridge #1",English,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Fantasy', 'Classics', 'Medieval', 'Audiobook', 'British Literature', 'Novels', 'Adult']",976,NAL Trade,02/04/02,648793,95.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1576956100l/5043.jpg,ken follett known worldwide master splitsecond suspense beloved bestselling book tells magnificent tale twelfthcentury monk driven seemingly impossible build greatest gothic cathedral world ever knowneverything readers expect follett intrigue fastpaced action passionate romance makes pillars earth extraordinary time twelfth century place feudal england subject building glorious cathedral follett recreated crude flamboyant england middle ages every detail vast forests walled towns castles monasteries become familiar landscape richly imagined intricately interwoven backdrop filled ravages war rhythms daily life master storyteller draws reader irresistibly intertwined lives characters dreams labors loves tom master builder aliena ravishingly beautiful noblewoman philip prior kingsbridge jack artist stone ellen woman forest casts terrifying curse humble stonemason imperious monarch character brought vividly lifethe building cathedral almost eerie artistry unschooled stonemasons center drama around site construction follett weaves story betrayal revenge love begins public hanging innocent man ends humiliation kingfor movie tiein edition isbn go alternate cover editionthe pillars earthken follett goodreads authorkingsbridge pillars earthken follett goodreads authorkingsbridge

Little Women,Louisa May Alcott,4.09,"Generations of readers young and old, male and female, have fallen in love with the March sisters of Louisa May Alcott’s most popular and enduring novel, Little Women. Here are talented tomboy and author-to-be Jo, tragically frail Beth, beautiful Meg, and romantic, spoiled Amy, united in their devotion to each other and their struggles to survive in New England during the Civil War.It is no secret that Alcott based Little Women on her own early life. While her father, the freethinking reformer and abolitionist Bronson Alcott, hobnobbed with such eminent male authors as Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne, Louisa supported herself and her sisters with ""woman’s work,” including sewing, doing laundry, and acting as a domestic servant. But she soon discovered she could make more money writing. Little Women brought her lasting fame and fortune, and far from being the ""girl’s book” her publisher requested, it explores such timeless themes as love and death, war and peace, the conflict between personal ambition and family responsibilities, and the clash of cultures between Europe and America.Little WomenLouisa May AlcottLittle Women #1Little WomenLouisa May AlcottLittle Women #1",English,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Literature', 'Childrens', 'Classic Literature', 'Novels']",449,Signet Classics,04/06/04,1681583,93.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1562690475l/1934._SY475_.jpg,generations readers young old male female fallen love march sisters louisa may alcotts popular enduring novel little women talented tomboy authortobe jo tragically frail beth beautiful meg romantic spoiled amy united devotion struggles survive new england civil warit secret alcott based little women early life father freethinking reformer abolitionist bronson alcott hobnobbed eminent male authors emerson thoreau hawthorne louisa supported sisters womans work including sewing laundry acting domestic servant soon discovered could make money writing little women brought lasting fame fortune far girls book publisher requested explores timeless themes love death war peace conflict personal ambition family responsibilities clash cultures europe americalittle womenlouisa may alcottlittle women little womenlouisa may alcottlittle women

My Sister's Keeper,Jodi Picoult (Goodreads Author),4.08,"Anna is not sick, but she might as well be.

Matilda,"Roald Dahl, Quentin Blake (Illustrator)",4.32,"Matilda is a little girl who is far too good to be true. At age five-and-a-half she's knocking off double-digit multiplication problems and blitz-reading Dickens. Even more remarkably, her classmates love her even though she's a super-nerd and the teacher's pet. But everything is not perfect in Matilda's world. For starters she has two of the most idiotic, self-centered parents who ever lived. Then there's the large, busty nightmare of a school principal, Miss (""The"") Trunchbull, a former hammer-throwing champion who flings children at will and is approximately as sympathetic as a bulldozer. Fortunately for Matilda, she has the inner resources to deal with such annoyances: astonishing intelligence, saintly patience, and an innate predilection for revenge.She warms up with some practical jokes aimed at her hapless parents, but the true test comes when she rallies in defense of her teacher, the sweet Miss Honey, against the diabolical Trunchbull. There is never any doubt that Matilda will carry the day. Even so, this wonderful story is far from predictable. Roald Dahl, while keeping the plot moving imaginatively, also has an unerring ear for emotional truth.

1984,George Orwell,4.19,"Among the seminal texts of the 20th century, Nineteen Eighty-Four is a rare work that grows more haunting as its futuristic purgatory becomes more real. Published in 1949, the book offers political satirist George Orwell's nightmarish vision of a totalitarian, bureaucratic world and one poor stiff's attempt to find individuality. The brilliance of the novel is Orwell's prescience of modern life—the ubiquity of television, the distortion of the language—and his ability to construct such a thorough version of hell.

Angela's Ashes,Frank McCourt,4.11,"Imbued on every page with Frank McCourt's astounding humor and compassion. This is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.""When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I managed to survive at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood."" So begins the Pulitzer Prize winning memoir of Frank McCourt, born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick, Ireland. Frank's mother, Angela, has no money to feed the children since Frank's father, Malachy, rarely works, and when he does he drinks his wages. Yet Malachy-- exasperating, irresponsible and beguiling-- does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story. Frank lives for his father's tales of Cuchulain, who saved Ireland, and of the Angel on the Seventh Step, who brings his mother babies. Perhaps it is story that accounts for Frank's survival. Wearing rags for diapers, begging a pig's head for Christmas dinner and gathering coal from the roadside to light a fire, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the casual cruelty of relatives and neighbors--yet lives to tell his tale with eloquence, exuberance and remarkable forgiveness.

Louis remembers Claudia's struggle to understand herself and the hatred they both have for Lestat that sends them halfway across the world to seek others of their kind. Louis and Claudia are desperate to find somewhere they belong, to find others who understand, and someone who knows what and why they are.Louis and Claudia travel Europe, eventually coming to Paris and the ragingly successful Theatre des Vampires--a theatre of vampires pretending to be mortals pretending to be vampires. Here they meet the magnetic and ethereal Armand, who brings them into a whole society of vampires.

And Then There Were None,Agatha Christie,4.26,"First, there were ten—a curious assortment of strangers summoned as weekend guests to a little private island off the coast of Devon. Their host, an eccentric millionaire unknown to all of them, is nowhere to be found. All that the guests have in common is a wicked past they're unwilling to reveal—and a secret that will seal their fate. For each has been marked for murder. A famous nursery rhyme is framed and hung in every room of the mansion:""Ten little boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were nine. Nine little boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight. Eight little boys traveling in Devon; One said he'd stay there then there were seven. Seven little boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in half and then there were six. Six little boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung one and then there were five. Five little boys going in for law; One got in Chancery and then there were four. Four little boys going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and then there were three. Three little boys walking in the zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were two. Two little boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was one. One little boy left all alone; He went out and hanged himself and then there were none.""When they realize that murders are occurring as described in the rhyme, terror mounts. One by one they fall prey. Before the weekend is out, there will be none. Who has choreographed this dastardly scheme? And who will be left to tell the tale?

The novel's vision of Soviet life in the 1930s is so ferociously accurate that it could not be published during its author's lifetime and appeared only in a censored edition in the 1960s. Its truths are so enduring that its language has become part of the common Russian speech.One hot spring, the devil arrives in Moscow, accompanied by a retinue that includes a beautiful naked witch and an immense talking black cat with a fondness for chess and vodka. The visitors quickly wreak havoc in a city that refuses to believe in either God or Satan. But they also bring peace to two unhappy Muscovites: one is the Master, a writer pilloried for daring to write a novel about Christ and Pontius Pilate; the other is Margarita, who loves the Master so deeply that she is willing literally to go to hell for him. What ensues is a novel of inexhaustible energy, humor, and philosophical depth, a work whose nuances emerge for the first time in Diana Burgin's and Katherine Tiernan O'Connor's splendid English version.(back cover)The Master and MargaritaMikhail Bulgakov, Katherine Tiernan O'Connor (Translator), Ellendea Proffer (Annotations and Afterword), Diana Lewis Burgin (Translator)The Master and MargaritaMikhail Bulgakov, Katherine Tiernan O'Connor (Translator), Ellendea Proffer (Annotations and Afterword), Diana Lewis Burgin (Translator)",English,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Russia', 'Fantasy', 'Russian Literature', 'Magical Realism', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Historical Fiction', '20th Century']",335,Vintage International,03/28/96,242684,94.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327867963l/117833.jpg,first complete annotated english translation mikhail bulgakovs comic masterpiecean audacious revision stories faust pontius pilate master margarita recognized one essential classics modern russian literature novels vision soviet life ferociously accurate could published authors lifetime appeared censored edition truths enduring language become part common russian speechone hot spring devil arrives moscow accompanied retinue includes beautiful naked witch immense talking black cat fondness chess vodka visitors quickly wreak havoc city refuses believe either god satan also bring peace two unhappy muscovites one master writer pilloried daring write novel christ pontius pilate margarita loves master deeply willing literally go hell ensues novel inexhaustible energy humor philosophical depth work whose nuances emerge first time diana burgins katherine tiernan oconnors splendid english versionback coverthe master margaritamikhail bulgakov katherine tiernan oconnor translator ellendea proffer annotations afterword diana lewis burgin translatorthe master margaritamikhail bulgakov katherine tiernan oconnor translator ellendea proffer annotations afterword diana lewis burgin translator

In Cold Blood,Truman Capote,4.07,"On November 15, 1959, in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas, four members of the Clutter family were savagely murdered by blasts from a shotgun held a few inches from their faces. There was no apparent motive for the crime, and there were almost no clues. As Truman Capote reconstructs the murder and the investigation that led to the capture, trial, and execution of the killers, he generates both mesmerizing suspense and astonishing empathy. At the center of his study are the amoral young killers Perry Smith and Dick Hickcock, who, vividly drawn by Capote, are shown to be reprehensible yet entirely and frighteningly human. In Cold Blood is a seminal work of modern prose, a remarkable synthesis of journalistic skill and powerfully evocative narrative.In Cold BloodTruman CapoteIn Cold BloodTruman Capote",English,"['Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'True Crime', 'Crime', 'Mystery', 'History', 'Literature', 'Thriller', 'American', 'Biography']",343,Vintage,10/28/94,529229,93.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1424931136l/168642.jpg,november small town holcomb kansas four members clutter family savagely murdered blasts shotgun held inches faces apparent motive crime almost clues truman capote reconstructs murder investigation led capture trial execution killers generates mesmerizing suspense astonishing empathy center study amoral young killers perry smith dick hickcock vividly drawn capote shown reprehensible yet entirely frighteningly human cold blood seminal work modern prose remarkable synthesis journalistic skill powerfully evocative narrativein cold bloodtruman capotein cold bloodtruman capote

The Thorn Birds,Colleen McCullough,4.23,"Alternate Cover Edition ISBN 0380018179 (ISBN13: 9780380018178)The Thorn Birds is a robust, romantic saga of a singular family, the Clearys. It begins in the early part of this century, when Paddy Cleary moves his wife, Fiona, and their seven children to Drogheda, the vast Australian sheep station owned by his autocratic and childless older sister; and it ends more than half a century later, when the only survivor of the third generation, the brilliant actress Justine O'Neill, sets a course of life and love halfway around the world from her roots.The central figures in this enthralling story are the indomitable Meggie, the only Cleary daughter, and the one man she truly loves, the stunningly handsome and ambitious priest Ralph de Bricassart. Ralph's course moves him a long way indeed, from a remote Outback parish to the halls of the Vatican; and Meggie's except for a brief and miserable marriage elsewhere, is fixed to the Drogheda that is part of her bones - but distance does not dim their feelings though it shapes their lives.Wonderful characters people this book; strong and gentle, Paddy, hiding a private memory; dutiful Fiona, holding back love because it once betrayed her, violent, tormented Frank, and the other hardworking Cleary sons who give the boundless lands of Drogheda the energy and devotion most men save for women; Meggie; Ralph; and Meggie's children, Justine and Dane. And the land itself; stark, relentless in its demands, brilliant in its flowering, prey to gigantic cycles of drought and flood, rich when nature is bountiful, surreal like no other place on earth.(First Edition Jacket)The Thorn BirdsColleen McCulloughThe Thorn BirdsColleen McCullough",English,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Romance', 'Classics', 'Australia', 'Historical', 'Historical Romance', 'Novels', 'Drama', 'Adult']",692,Avon Books,10/28/02,314471,95.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1548530867l/3412._SY475_.jpg,alternate cover edition isbn isbn thorn birds robust romantic saga singular family clearys begins early part century paddy cleary moves wife fiona seven children drogheda vast australian sheep station owned autocratic childless older sister ends half century later survivor third generation brilliant actress justine oneill sets course life love halfway around world rootsthe central figures enthralling story indomitable meggie cleary daughter one man truly loves stunningly handsome ambitious priest ralph de bricassart ralphs course moves long way indeed remote outback parish halls vatican meggies except brief miserable marriage elsewhere fixed drogheda part bones distance dim feelings though shapes liveswonderful characters people book strong gentle paddy hiding private memory dutiful fiona holding back love betrayed violent tormented frank hardworking cleary sons give boundless lands drogheda energy devotion men save women meggie ralph meggies children justine dane land stark relentless demands brilliant flowering prey gigantic cycles drought flood rich nature bountiful surreal like place earthfirst edition jacketthe thorn birdscolleen mcculloughthe thorn birdscolleen mccullough
A Walk to Remember,Nicholas Sparks (Goodreads Author),4.18,"There was a time when the world was sweeter...when the women in Beaufort, North Carolina, wore dresses, and the men donned hats...when something happened to a seventeen-year-old boy that would change his life forever. Every April, when the wind blows in from the sea and mingles with the scent of lilacs, Landon Carter remembers his last year at Beaufort High. It was 1958, and Landon had already dated a girl or two. He even swore that he had once been in love. Certainly the last person in town he thought he'd fall for was Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of the town's Baptist minister. A quiet girl who always carried a Bible with her schoolbooks, Jamie seemed content living in a world apart from the other teens. She took care of her widowed father, rescued hurt animals, and helped out at the local orphanage. No boy had ever asked her out. Landon would never have dreamed of it. Then a twist of fate made Jamie his partner for the homecoming dance, and Landon Carter's life would never be the same. Being with Jamie would show him the depths of the human heart and lead him to a decision so stunning it would send him irrevocably on the road to manhood. No other author today touches our emotions more deeply than Nicholas Sparks.Illuminating both the strength and the gossamer fragility of our deepest emotions, his two New York Times bestsellers, The Notebook and Message in a Bottle, have established him as the leading author of today's most cherished love stories. Now, in A Walk to Remember, he tells a truly unforgettable story, one that glimmers with all of his magic, holding us spellbound-and reminding us that in life each of us may find one great love, the kind that changes everything...A Walk to RememberNicholas Sparks (Goodreads Author)A Walk to RememberNicholas Sparks (Goodreads Author)",English,"['Romance', 'Fiction', 'Chick Lit', 'Contemporary', 'Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Drama', 'Contemporary Romance', 'Love']",215,Grand Central Publishing,05/24/00,673094,94.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1498755310l/35545737._SY475_.jpg,time world sweeterwhen women beaufort north carolina wore dresses men donned hatswhen something happened seventeenyearold boy would change life forever every april wind blows sea mingles scent lilacs landon carter remembers last year beaufort high landon already dated girl two even swore love certainly last person town thought hed fall jamie sullivan daughter towns baptist minister quiet girl always carried bible schoolbooks jamie seemed content living world apart teens took care widowed father rescued hurt animals helped local orphanage boy ever asked landon would never dreamed twist fate made jamie partner homecoming dance landon carters life would never jamie would show depths human heart lead decision stunning would send irrevocably road manhood author today touches emotions deeply nicholas sparksilluminating strength gossamer fragility deepest emotions two new york times bestsellers notebook message bottle established leading author todays cherished love stories walk remember tells truly unforgettable story one glimmers magic holding us spellboundand reminding us life us may find one great love kind changes everythinga walk remembernicholas sparks goodreads authora walk remembernicholas sparks goodreads author
How the Grinch Stole Christmas!,Dr. Seuss,4.36,"""The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season!Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.""Dr. Seuss's small-hearted Grinch ranks right up there with Scrooge when it comes to the crankiest, scowling holiday grumps of all time. For 53 years, the Grinch has lived in a cave on the side of a mountain, looming above the Whos in Whoville. The noisy holiday preparations and infernal singing of the happy little citizens below annoy him to no end. The Grinch decides this frivolous merriment must stop. His ""wonderful, awful"" idea is to don a Santa outfit, strap heavy antlers on his poor, quivering dog Max, construct a makeshift sleigh, head down to Whoville, and strip the chafingly cheerful Whos of their Yuletide glee once and for all.Looking quite out of place and very disturbing in his makeshift Santa get-up, the Grinch slithers down chimneys with empty bags and stealing the Whos' presents, their food, even the logs from their humble Who-fires. He takes the ramshackle sleigh to Mt. Crumpit to dump it and waits to hear the sobs of the Whos when they wake up and discover the trappings of Christmas have disappeared. Imagine the Whos' dismay when they discover the evil-doings of Grinch in his anti-Santa guise. But what is that sound? It's not sobbing, but singing! Children simultaneously adore and fear this triumphant, twisted Seussian testimonial to the undaunted cheerfulness of the Whos, the transcendent nature of joy, and of course, the growth potential of a heart that's two sizes too small. This holiday classic is perfect for reading aloud to your favorite little Whos.How the Grinch Stole Christmas!Dr. SeussHow the Grinch Stole Christmas!Dr. Seuss",English,"['Childrens', 'Picture Books', 'Christmas', 'Classics', 'Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Holiday', 'Fantasy', 'Humor', 'Kids']",64,Harper Collins Children's Books,10/04/04,330214,95.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327958149l/113946.jpg,grinch hated christmas whole christmas seasonnow please dont ask one quite knows reasondr seusss smallhearted grinch ranks right scrooge comes crankiest scowling holiday grumps time years grinch lived cave side mountain looming whos whoville noisy holiday preparations infernal singing happy little citizens annoy end grinch decides frivolous merriment must stop wonderful awful idea santa outfit strap heavy antlers poor quivering dog max construct makeshift sleigh head whoville strip chafingly cheerful whos yuletide glee alllooking quite place disturbing makeshift santa getup grinch slithers chimneys empty bags stealing whos presents food even logs humble whofires takes ramshackle sleigh mt crumpit dump waits hear sobs whos wake discover trappings christmas disappeared imagine whos dismay discover evildoings grinch antisanta guise sound sobbing singing children simultaneously adore fear triumphant twisted seussian testimonial undaunted cheerfulness whos transcendent nature joy course growth potential heart thats two sizes small holiday classic perfect reading aloud favorite little whoshow grinch stole christmasdr seusshow grinch stole christmasdr seuss

The Three Musketeers,Alexandre Dumas,4.07,"Alexandre Dumas’s most famous tale— and possibly the most famous historical novel of all time— in a handsome hardcover volume.This swashbuckling epic of chivalry, honor, and derring-do, set in France during the 1620s, is richly populated with romantic heroes, unattainable heroines, kings, queens, cavaliers, and criminals in a whirl of adventure, espionage, conspiracy, murder, vengeance, love, scandal, and suspense. Dumas transforms minor historical figures into larger- than-life characters: the Comte d’Artagnan, an impetuous young man in pursuit of glory; the beguilingly evil seductress “Milady”; the powerful and devious Cardinal Richelieu; the weak King Louis XIII and his unhappy queen—and, of course, the three musketeers themselves, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, whose motto “all for one, one for all” has come to epitomize devoted friendship. With a plot that delivers stolen diamonds, masked balls, purloined letters, and, of course, great bouts of swordplay, The Three Musketeers is eternally entertaining.The Three MusketeersAlexandre DumasThe d'Artagnan Romances #1The Three MusketeersAlexandre DumasThe d'Artagnan Romances #1",English,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Adventure', 'France', 'Literature', 'Historical', 'French Literature', 'Classic Literature', 'Novels']",625,Modern Library,02/13/01,273714,95.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320436982l/7190.jpg,alexandre dumass famous tale possibly famous historical novel time handsome hardcover volumethis swashbuckling epic chivalry honor derringdo set france richly populated romantic heroes unattainable heroines kings queens cavaliers criminals whirl adventure espionage conspiracy murder vengeance love scandal suspense dumas transforms minor historical figures larger thanlife characters comte dartagnan impetuous young man pursuit glory beguilingly evil seductress milady powerful devious cardinal richelieu weak king louis xiii unhappy queenand course three musketeers athos porthos aramis whose motto one one come epitomize devoted friendship plot delivers stolen diamonds masked balls purloined letters course great bouts swordplay three musketeers eternally entertainingthe three musketeersalexandre dumasthe dartagnan romances three musketeersalexandre dumasthe dartagnan romances

But what if, for once, the predictions are right, and the apocalypse really is due to arrive next Saturday, just after tea?You could spend the time left drowning your sorrows, giving away all your possessions in preparation for the rapture, or laughing it off as (hopefully) just another hoax. Or you could just try to do something about it.It’s a predicament that Aziraphale, a somewhat fussy angel, and Crowley, a fast-living demon now finds themselves in.

Blood Promise,Richelle Mead (Goodreads Author),4.32,"Bound by love, but sworn to kill...The world thought Dimitri was dead. And to a certain extent, he was. But I hadn't been able to forget a conversation he and I had once had. We'd both agreed that we'd rather be dead - truly dead - than walk the world as Strigoi. It was time to honor our words.Guardian Rose Hathaway's life will never be the same. The recent attack on St. Vladimir's Academy devastated the entire Moroi world. Many are dead. And, for the few victims carried off by Strigoi, their fates are even worse.

Rose must now choose one of two very different paths: honoring her life's vow to protect Lissa—her best friend and the last surviving Dragomir princess—or, dropping out of the Academy to strike out on her own and hunt down the man she loves. She'll have to go to the ends of the earth to find Dimitri and keep the promise he begged her to make. But the question is, when the time comes, will he want to be saved?Now, with everything at stake—and worlds away from St. Vladimir's and her unguarded, vulnerable, and newly rebellious best friend—can Rose find the strength to destroy Dimitri?

David Copperfield,"Charles Dickens, Jeremy Tambling (Introduction)",4.0,"David Copperfield is the story of a young man's adventures on his journey from an unhappy and impoverished childhood to the discovery of his vocation as a successful novelist. Among the gloriously vivid cast of characters he encounters are his tyrannical stepfather, Mr Murdstone; his brilliant, but ultimately unworthy school-friend James Steerforth; his formidable aunt, Betsey Trotwood; the eternally humble, yet treacherous Uriah Heep; frivolous, enchanting Dora Spenlow; and the magnificently impecunious Wilkins Micawber, one of literature's great comic creations. In David Copperfield - the novel he described as his 'favourite child' - Dickens drew revealingly on his own experiences to create one of the most exuberant and enduringly popular works, filled with tragedy and comedy in equal measure. This edition uses the text of the first volume publication of 1850, and includes updated suggestions for further reading, original illustrations by 'Phiz', a revised chronology and expanded notes.

Man's Search for Meaning,"Viktor E. Frankl, Harold S. Kushner (Foreword), William J. Winslade (Afterword), Isle Lasch (Translator)",4.36,"Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl's memoir has riveted generations of readers with its descriptions of life in Nazi death camps and its lessons for spiritual survival. Based on his own experience and the stories of his patients, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose. At the heart of his theory, known as logotherapy, is a conviction that the primary human drive is not pleasure but the pursuit of what we find meaningful. Man's Search for Meaning has become one of the most influential books in America; it continues to inspire us all to find significance in the very act of living.Man's Search for MeaningViktor E.

Marley and Me: Life and Love With the World's Worst Dog,John Grogan,4.13,"John and Jenny were just beginning their life together. They were young and in love, with a perfect little house and not a care in the world. Then they brought home Marley, a wiggly yellow furball of a puppy. Life would never be the same.Marley quickly grew into a barreling, ninety-seven-pound streamroller of a Labrador retriever, a dog like no other. He crashed through screen doors, gouged through drywall, flung drool on guests, stole women's undergarments, and ate nearly everything he could get his mouth around, including couches and fine jewelry. Obedience school did no good—Marley was expelled. Neither did the tranquilizers the veterinarian prescribed for him with the admonishment, ""Don't hesitate to use these.""And yet Marley's heart was pure. Just as he joyfully refused any limits on his behavior, his love and loyalty were boundless, too. Marley shared the couple's joy at their first pregnancy, and their heartbreak over the miscarriage. He was there when babies finally arrived and when the screams of a seventeen-year-old stabbing victim pierced the night. Marley shut down a public beach and managed to land a role in a feature-length movie, always winning hearts as he made a mess of things. Through it all, he remained steadfast, a model of devotion, even when his family was at its wit's end. Unconditional love, they would learn, comes in many forms.Marley and Me: Life and Love With the World's Worst DogJohn GroganMarley and Me: Life and Love With the World's Worst DogJohn Grogan",English,"['Nonfiction', 'Animals', 'Memoir', 'Dogs', 'Biography', 'Humor', 'Biography Memoir', 'Adult', 'Contemporary', 'Autobiography']",291,William Morrow; 1ST edition,10/18/05,440572,95.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1308858322l/12691.jpg,john jenny beginning life together young love perfect little house care world brought home marley wiggly yellow furball puppy life would never samemarley quickly grew barreling ninetysevenpound streamroller labrador retriever dog like crashed screen doors gouged drywall flung drool guests stole womens undergarments ate nearly everything could get mouth around including couches fine jewelry obedience school goodmarley expelled neither tranquilizers veterinarian prescribed admonishment dont hesitate use theseand yet marleys heart pure joyfully refused limits behavior love loyalty boundless marley shared couples joy first pregnancy heartbreak miscarriage babies finally arrived screams seventeenyearold stabbing victim pierced night marley shut public beach managed land role featurelength movie always winning hearts made mess things remained steadfast model devotion even family wits end unconditional love would learn comes many formsmarley life love worlds worst dogjohn groganmarley life love worlds worst dogjohn grogan

The Diary of a Young Girl,"Anne Frank, Eleanor Roosevelt (Introduction), 郭清玲 (Translator), Barbara Mooyaart-Doubleday (Translator)",4.15,"Discovered in the attic in which she spent the last years of her life, Anne Frank’s remarkable diary has become a world classic—a powerful reminder of the horrors of war and an eloquent testament to the human spirit. In 1942, with the Nazis occupying Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, the Franks and another family lived cloistered in the “Secret Annexe” of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death. In her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period. By turns thoughtful, moving, and surprisingly humorous, her account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short.--back coverThe Diary of a Young GirlAnne Frank, Eleanor Roosevelt (Introduction), 郭清玲 (Translator), Barbara Mooyaart-Doubleday (Translator)The Diary of a Young GirlAnne Frank, Eleanor Roosevelt (Introduction), 郭清玲 (Translator), Barbara Mooyaart-Doubleday (Translator)",English,"['Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'History', 'Biography', 'Memoir', 'Historical', 'Holocaust', 'Autobiography', 'War', 'World War II']",283,Bantam,07/28/93,2741134,94.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1560816565l/48855.jpg,discovered attic spent last years life anne franks remarkable diary become world classica powerful reminder horrors war eloquent testament human spirit nazis occupying holland thirteenyearold jewish girl family fled home amsterdam went hiding next two years whereabouts betrayed gestapo franks another family lived cloistered secret annexe old office building cut outside world faced hunger boredom constant cruelties living confined quarters everpresent threat discovery death diary anne frank recorded vivid impressions experiences period turns thoughtful moving surprisingly humorous account offers fascinating commentary human courage frailty compelling selfportrait sensitive spirited young woman whose promise tragically cut shortback coverthe diary young girlanne frank eleanor roosevelt introduction translator barbara mooyaartdoubleday translatorthe diary young girlanne frank eleanor roosevelt introduction translator barbara mooyaartdoubleday translator

Travis Maddox, lean, cut, and covered in tattoos, is exactly what Abby needs—and wants—to avoid. He spends his nights winning money in a floating fight ring, and his days as the ultimate college campus charmer. Intrigued by Abby’s resistance to his appeal, Travis tricks her into his daily life with a simple bet. If he loses, he must remain abstinent for a month. If Abby loses, she must live in Travis’s apartment for the same amount of time. Either way, Travis has no idea that he has met his match.Beautiful DisasterJamie McGuire (Goodreads Author)Beautiful #1Beautiful DisasterJamie McGuire (Goodreads Author)Beautiful #1",English,"['Romance', 'New Adult', 'Contemporary', 'Young Adult', 'Contemporary Romance', 'College', 'Fiction', 'Chick Lit', 'Adult', 'Love']",319,Jamie McGuire,05/26/11,546801,90.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1358259032l/11505797.jpg,new abby abernathy good girl doesnt drink swear appropriate number cardigans wardrobe abby believes enough distance darkness past arrives college best friend path new beginning quickly challenged eastern universitys walking onenight stand travis maddox lean cut covered tattoos exactly abby needsand wantsto avoid spends nights winning money floating fight ring days ultimate college campus charmer intrigued abbys resistance appeal travis tricks daily life simple bet loses must remain abstinent month abby loses must live traviss apartment amount time either way travis idea met matchbeautiful disasterjamie mcguire goodreads authorbeautiful beautiful disasterjamie mcguire goodreads authorbeautiful

Speak,Laurie Halse Anderson (Goodreads Author),4.02,"The first ten lies they tell you in high school.""Speak up for yourself—we want to know what you have to say."" From the first moment of her freshman year at Merryweather High, Melinda knows this is a big fat lie, part of the nonsense of high school. She is friendless, outcast, because she busted an end-of-summer party by calling the cops, so now nobody will talk to her, let alone listen to her. As time passes, she becomes increasingly isolated and practically stops talking altogether. Only her art class offers any solace, and it is through her work on an art project that she is finally able to face what really happened at that terrible party: she was raped by an upperclassman, a guy who still attends Merryweather and is still a threat to her. Her healing process has just begun when she has another violent encounter with him. But this time Melinda fights back, refuses to be silent, and thereby achieves a measure of vindication. In Laurie Halse Anderson's powerful novel, an utterly believable heroine with a bitterly ironic voice delivers a blow to the hypocritical world of high school. She speaks for many a disenfranchised teenager while demonstrating the importance of speaking up for oneself.Speak was a 1999 National Book Award Finalist for Young People's Literature.SpeakLaurie Halse Anderson (Goodreads Author)SpeakLaurie Halse Anderson (Goodreads Author)",English,"['Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Realistic Fiction', 'Teen', 'Mental Health', 'High School', 'Coming Of Age', 'School', 'Abuse']",224,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux (Byr)",01/15/19,484810,92.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1529044298l/39280444.jpg,first ten lies tell high schoolspeak yourselfwe want know say first moment freshman year merryweather high melinda knows big fat lie part nonsense high school friendless outcast busted endofsummer party calling cops nobody talk let alone listen time passes becomes increasingly isolated practically stops talking altogether art class offers solace work art project finally able face really happened terrible party raped upperclassman guy still attends merryweather still threat healing process begun another violent encounter time melinda fights back refuses silent thereby achieves measure vindication laurie halse andersons powerful novel utterly believable heroine bitterly ironic voice delivers blow hypocritical world high school speaks many disenfranchised teenager demonstrating importance speaking oneselfspeak national book award finalist young peoples literaturespeaklaurie halse anderson goodreads authorspeaklaurie halse anderson goodreads author

Gone Girl,Gillian Flynn (Goodreads Author),4.08,"Marriage can be a real killer.On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer?As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister, Margo, at his side, Nick stands by his innocence. Trouble is, if Nick didn’t do it, where is that beautiful wife?

Kafka on the Shore,"Haruki Murakami, Philip Gabriel (Translator)",4.13,"Kafka on the Shore, a tour de force of metaphysical reality, is powered by two remarkable characters: a teenage boy, Kafka Tamura, who runs away from home either to escape a gruesome oedipal prophecy or to search for his long-missing mother and sister; and an aging simpleton called Nakata, who never recovered from a wartime affliction and now is drawn toward Kafka for reasons that, like the most basic activities of daily life, he cannot fathom. Their odyssey, as mysterious to them as it is to us, is enriched throughout by vivid accomplices and mesmerizing events. Cats and people carry on conversations, a ghostlike pimp employs a Hegel-quoting prostitute, a forest harbors soldiers apparently unaged since World War II, and rainstorms of fish (and worse) fall from the sky. There is a brutal murder, with the identity of both victim and perpetrator a riddle—yet this, along with everything else, is eventually answered, just as the entwined destinies of Kafka and Nakata are gradually revealed, with one escaping his fate entirely and the other given a fresh start on his own.Kafka on the ShoreHaruki Murakami, Philip Gabriel (Translator)海辺のカフカKafka on the ShoreHaruki Murakami, Philip Gabriel (Translator)海辺のカフカ",English,"['Fiction', 'Magical Realism', 'Japan', 'Fantasy', 'Japanese Literature', 'Contemporary', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Literary Fiction', 'Asia']",467,Vintage International,01/03/06,305688,95.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1429638085l/4929.jpg,kafka shore tour de force metaphysical reality powered two remarkable characters teenage boy kafka tamura runs away home either escape gruesome oedipal prophecy search longmissing mother sister aging simpleton called nakata never recovered wartime affliction drawn toward kafka reasons like basic activities daily life fathom odyssey mysterious us enriched throughout vivid accomplices mesmerizing events cats people carry conversations ghostlike pimp employs hegelquoting prostitute forest harbors soldiers apparently unaged since world war ii rainstorms fish worse fall sky brutal murder identity victim perpetrator riddleyet along everything else eventually answered entwined destinies kafka nakata gradually revealed one escaping fate entirely given fresh start ownkafka shoreharuki murakami philip gabriel translatorkafka shoreharuki murakami philip gabriel translator

The Wise Man's Fear,Patrick Rothfuss (Goodreads Author),4.56,"“There are three things all wise men fear: the sea in storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man.”My name is Kvothe.I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep.You may have heard of me.So begins the tale of a hero told from his own point of view — a story unequaled in fantasy literature. Now in The Wise Man's Fear, an escalating rivalry with a powerful member of the nobility forces Kvothe to leave the University and seek his fortune abroad. Adrift, penniless, and alone, he travels to Vintas, where he quickly becomes entangled in the politics of courtly society. While attempting to curry favor with a powerful noble, Kvothe uncovers an assassination attempt, comes into conflict with a rival arcanist, and leads a group of mercenaries into the wild, in an attempt to solve the mystery of who (or what) is waylaying travelers on the King's Road.All the while, Kvothe searches for answers, attempting to uncover the truth about the mysterious Amyr, the Chandrian, and the death of his parents. Along the way, Kvothe is put on trial by the legendary Adem mercenaries, is forced to reclaim the honor of the Edema Ruh, and travels into the Fae realm. There he meets Felurian, the faerie woman no man can resist, and who no man has ever survived ... until Kvothe.In The Wise Man's Fear, Kvothe takes his first steps on the path of the hero and learns how difficult life can be when a man becomes a legend in his own time.The Wise Man's FearPatrick Rothfuss (Goodreads Author)The Kingkiller Chronicle #2The Wise Man's FearPatrick Rothfuss (Goodreads Author)The Kingkiller Chronicle #2",English,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Epic Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adventure', 'Audiobook', 'Adult', 'Epic']",994,DAW Books,03/01/11,427730,98.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1452624392l/1215032.jpg,three things wise men fear sea storm night moon anger gentle manmy name kvothei stolen princesses back sleeping barrow kings burned town trebon spent night felurian left sanity life expelled university younger age people allowed tread paths moonlight others fear speak day talked gods loved women written songs make minstrels weepyou may heard meso begins tale hero told point view story unequaled fantasy literature wise mans fear escalating rivalry powerful member nobility forces kvothe leave university seek fortune abroad adrift penniless alone travels vintas quickly becomes entangled politics courtly society attempting curry favor powerful noble kvothe uncovers assassination attempt comes conflict rival arcanist leads group mercenaries wild attempt solve mystery waylaying travelers kings roadall kvothe searches answers attempting uncover truth mysterious amyr chandrian death parents along way kvothe put trial legendary adem mercenaries forced reclaim honor edema ruh travels fae realm meets felurian faerie woman man resist man ever survived kvothein wise mans fear kvothe takes first steps path hero learns difficult life man becomes legend timethe wise mans fearpatrick rothfuss goodreads authorthe kingkiller chronicle wise mans fearpatrick rothfuss goodreads authorthe kingkiller chronicle

The Son of Neptune,Rick Riordan (Goodreads Author),4.43,"PERCY IS CONFUSED. When he awoke from his long sleep, he didn't know much more than his name. His brain fuzz is lingering, even after the wolf Lupa told him he is a demigod and trained him to fight with the pen/sword in his pocket. Somehow Percy manages to make it to a camp for half-bloods, despite the fact that he has to keep killing monsters along the way. But the camp doesn't ring any bells with him. The only thing he can recall from his past is another name: Annabeth. HAZEL IS SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD. When she lived before, she didn't do a very good job of it. Sure, she was an obedient daughter, even when her mother was possessed by greed. But that was the problem—when the Voice took over her mother and commanded Hazel to use her ""gift"" for an evil purpose, Hazel couldn't say no. Now because of her mistake, the future of the world is at risk. Hazel wishes she could ride away from it all on the stallion that appears in her dreams.FRANK IS A KLUTZ. His grandmother says he is descended from heroes and can be anything he wants to be, but he doesn't see it. He doesn't even know who his father is. He keeps hoping Apollo will claim him, because the only thing he is good at is archery—although not good enough to win camp war games. His bulky physique makes him feel like an ox, especially in front of Hazel, his closest friend at camp. He trusts her completely—enough to share the secret he holds close to his heart.Beginning at the ""other"" camp for half-bloods and extending as far as the land beyond the gods, this breathtaking second installment of the Heroes of Olympus series introduces new demigods, revives fearsome monsters, and features other remarkable creatures, all destined to play a part in the Prophesy of Seven.The Son of NeptuneRick Riordan (Goodreads Author)The Heroes of Olympus #2The Son of NeptuneRick Riordan (Goodreads Author)The Heroes of Olympus #2",English,"['Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Mythology', 'Fiction', 'Middle Grade', 'Adventure', 'Greek Mythology', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Childrens', 'Young Adult Fantasy']",513,Disney ● Hyperion Books,10/04/11,412823,98.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1464201114l/9520360._SY475_.jpg,percy confused awoke long sleep didnt know much name brain fuzz lingering even wolf lupa told demigod trained fight pensword pocket somehow percy manages make camp halfbloods despite fact keep killing monsters along way camp doesnt ring bells thing recall past another name annabeth hazel supposed dead lived didnt good job sure obedient daughter even mother possessed greed problemwhen voice took mother commanded hazel use gift evil purpose hazel couldnt say mistake future world risk hazel wishes could ride away stallion appears dreamsfrank klutz grandmother says descended heroes anything wants doesnt see doesnt even know father keeps hoping apollo claim thing good archeryalthough good enough win camp war games bulky physique makes feel like ox especially front hazel closest friend camp trusts completelyenough share secret holds close heartbeginning camp halfbloods extending far land beyond gods breathtaking second installment heroes olympus series introduces new demigods revives fearsome monsters features remarkable creatures destined play part prophesy seventhe son neptunerick riordan goodreads authorthe heroes olympus son neptunerick riordan goodreads authorthe heroes olympus

A Short History of Nearly Everything,Bill Bryson,4.2,"In Bryson's biggest book, he confronts his greatest challenge: to understand—and, if possible, answer—the oldest, biggest questions we have posed about the universe and ourselves. Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world’s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. A Short History of Nearly Everything is the record of this quest, and it is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it. Science has never been more involving or entertaining.A Short History of Nearly EverythingBill BrysonA Short History of Nearly EverythingBill Bryson",English,"['Nonfiction', 'Science', 'History', 'Audiobook', 'Humor', 'Popular Science', 'Physics', 'Historical', 'Philosophy', 'Unfinished']",544,Broadway Books,09/14/04,298196,94.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1433086293l/21._SY475_.jpg,brysons biggest book confronts greatest challenge understandand possible answerthe oldest biggest questions posed universe taking territory everything big bang rise civilization bryson seeks understand got nothing us end attached host worlds advanced often obsessed archaeologists anthropologists mathematicians travelling offices laboratories field camps read tried read books pestered questions apprenticed powerful minds short history nearly everything record quest sometimes profound sometimes funny always supremely clear entertaining adventure realms human knowledge bill bryson render science never involving entertaininga short history nearly everythingbill brysona short history nearly everythingbill bryson
The Lord of the Rings,J.R.R. Tolkien,4.5,"One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind themIn ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell by chance into the hands of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins.From Sauron's fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor, his power spread far and wide. Sauron gathered all the Great Rings to him, but always he searched for the One Ring that would complete his dominion.When Bilbo reached his eleventy-first birthday he disappeared, bequeathing to his young cousin Frodo the Ruling Ring and a perilous quest: to journey across Middle-earth, deep into the shadow of the Dark Lord, and destroy the Ring by casting it into the Cracks of Doom.The Lord of the Rings tells of the great quest undertaken by Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring: Gandalf the Wizard; the hobbits Merry, Pippin, and Sam; Gimli the Dwarf; Legolas the Elf; Boromir of Gondor; and a tall, mysterious stranger called Strider.The Lord of the RingsJ.R.R.

The Way of Kings,Brandon Sanderson (Goodreads Author),4.63,"From #1 New York Times bestselling author Brandon Sanderson, The Way of Kings, book one of The Stormlight Archive begins an incredible new saga of epic proportion.Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them.One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.Speak again the ancient oaths:Life before death.Strength before weakness.Journey before Destination.and return to men the Shards they once bore.The Knights Radiant must stand again.The Way of KingsBrandon Sanderson (Goodreads Author)The Stormlight Archive #1The Way of KingsBrandon Sanderson (Goodreads Author)The Stormlight Archive #1",English,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Epic Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adult', 'Epic', 'Magic', 'Adventure']",1007,Tor Books,08/31/10,302877,98.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388184640l/7235533.jpg,new york times bestselling author brandon sanderson way kings book one stormlight archive begins incredible new saga epic proportionroshar world stone storms uncanny tempests incredible power sweep across rocky terrain frequently shaped ecology civilization alike animals hide shells trees pull branches grass retracts soilless ground cities built topography offers shelterit centuries since fall ten consecrated orders known knights radiant shardblades shardplate remain mystical swords suits armor transform ordinary men nearinvincible warriors men trade kingdoms shardblades wars fought themone war rages ruined landscape called shattered plains kaladin traded medical apprenticeship spear protect little brother reduced slavery war makes sense ten armies fight separately single foe struggles save men fathom leaders consider expendablebrightlord dalinar kholin commands one armies like brother late king fascinated ancient text called way kings troubled overpowering visions ancient times knights radiant begun doubt sanityacross ocean untried young woman named shallan seeks train eminent scholar notorious heretic dalinars niece jasnah though genuinely loves learning shallans motives less pure plans daring theft research jasnah hints secrets knights radiant true cause warthe result ten years planning writing worldbuilding way kings opening movement stormlight archive bold masterpiece makingspeak ancient oathslife deathstrength weaknessjourney destinationand return men shards borethe knights radiant must stand againthe way kingsbrandon sanderson goodreads authorthe stormlight archive way kingsbrandon sanderson goodreads authorthe stormlight archive

The Hound of the Baskervilles,"Arthur Conan Doyle, Anne Perry (Afterword)",4.12,"We owe The Hound of the Baskervilles (1902) to Arthur Conan Doyle's good friend Fletcher ""Bobbles"" Robinson, who took him to visit some scary English moors and prehistoric ruins, and told him marvelous local legends about escaped prisoners and a 17th-century aristocrat who fell afoul of the family dog. Doyle transmogrified the legend: generations ago, a hound of hell tore out the throat of devilish Hugo Baskerville on the moonlit moor. Poor, accursed Baskerville Hall now has another mysterious death: that of Sir Charles Baskerville. Could the culprit somehow be mixed up with secretive servant Barrymore, history-obsessed Dr. Frankland, butterfly-chasing Stapleton, or Selden, the Notting Hill murderer at large? Someone's been signaling with candles from the mansion's windows. Nor can supernatural forces be ruled out. Can Dr. Watson--left alone by Sherlock Holmes to sleuth in fear for much of the novel--save the next Baskerville, Sir Henry, from the hound's fangs? Many Holmes fans prefer Doyle's complete short stories, but their clockwork logic doesn't match the author's boast about this novel: it's ""a real Creeper!"" What distinguishes this particular Hound is its fulfillment of Doyle's great debt to Edgar Allan Poe--it's full of ancient woe, low moans, a Grimpen Mire that sucks ponies to Dostoyevskian deaths, and locals digging up Neolithic skulls without next-of-kins' consent. ""The longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one's soul,"" Watson realizes. ""Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay ... while a false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet ... it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths.""

  ACE #1
This book chronicles the unforgettable account of one of the most severe child abuse cases in California history. It is the story of Dave Pelzer, who was brutally beaten and starved by his emotionally unstable, alcoholic mother: a mother who played tortuous, unpredictable games—games that left him nearly dead. He had to learn how to play his mother's games in order to survive because she no longer considered him a son, but a slave; and no longer a boy, but an ""it."" Dave's bed was an old army cot in the basement, and his clothes were torn and raunchy. When his mother allowed him the luxury of food, it was nothing more than spoiled scraps that even the dogs refused to eat. The outside world knew nothing of his living nightmare. He had nothing or no one to turn to, but his dreams kept him alive—dreams of someone taking care of him, loving him and calling him their son.A Child Called ""It""Dave Pelzer (Goodreads Author)Dave Pelzer #1A Child Called ""It""Dave Pelzer (Goodreads Author)Dave Pelzer #1",English,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Psychology', 'Autobiography', 'Abuse', 'Adult', 'Biography Memoir', 'True Crime', 'True Story']",184,Health Communications Inc,09/01/95,378898,93.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1438400434l/60748._SY475_.jpg,also see alternate cover editions isbn ace ace book chronicles unforgettable account one severe child abuse cases california history story dave pelzer brutally beaten starved emotionally unstable alcoholic mother mother played tortuous unpredictable gamesgames left nearly dead learn play mothers games order survive longer considered son slave longer boy daves bed old army cot basement clothes torn raunchy mother allowed luxury food nothing spoiled scraps even dogs refused eat outside world knew nothing living nightmare nothing one turn dreams kept alivedreams someone taking care loving calling sona child called itdave pelzer goodreads authordave pelzer child called itdave pelzer goodreads authordave pelzer

Now part of the Voyager Classics collection.The Martian Chronicles tells the story of humanity’s repeated attempts to colonize the red planet. The first men were few. Most succumbed to a disease they called the Great Loneliness when they saw their home planet dwindle to the size of a fist. They felt they had never been born. Those few that survived found no welcome on Mars. The shape-changing Martians thought they were native lunatics and duly locked them up.But more rockets arrived from Earth, and more, piercing the hallucinations projected by the Martians. People brought their old prejudices with them – and their desires and fantasies, tainted dreams.

A mysterious, magnetic, gorgeous guardian angel. But despite his role in her life, Patch has been acting anything but angelic. He's more elusive than ever (if that's possible) and what's worse, he seems to be spending time with Nora's archenemy, Marcie Millar.Nora would have hardly noticed Scott Parnell, an old family friend who has moved back to town, if Patch hadn't been acting so distant. Even with Scott's totally infuriating attitude, Nora finds herself drawn to him - despite her lingering feelings that he is hiding something.If that weren't enough, Nora is haunted by images of her murdered father, and comes to question whether her Nephilim bloodline has anything to do with his death. Desperate to figure out what happened, she puts herself in increasingly dangerous situations to get the answer.

East of Eden,John Steinbeck,4.38,"In his journal, Nobel Prize winner John Steinbeck called East of Eden “the first book,” and indeed it has the primordial power and simplicity of myth. Set in the rich farmland of California’s Salinas Valley, this sprawling and often brutal novel follows the intertwined destinies of two families—the Trasks and the Hamiltons—whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel.Adam Trask came to California from the East to farm and raise his family on the new rich land. But the birth of his twins, Cal and Aaron, brings his wife to the brink of madness, and Adam is left alone to raise his boys to manhood. One boy thrives nurtured by the love of all those around him; the other grows up in loneliness enveloped by a mysterious darkness.First published in 1952, East of Eden is the work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the inexplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love's absence. A masterpiece of Steinbeck's later years, East of Eden is a powerful and vastly ambitious novel that is at once a family saga and a modern retelling of the Book of Genesis.--jacket flapEast of EdenJohn SteinbeckEast of EdenJohn Steinbeck",English,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'American', 'Literary Fiction', 'Historical', 'Classic Literature', 'Adult']",601,Penguin Books,10/28/02,428907,96.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1544744853l/4406.jpg,journal nobel prize winner john steinbeck called east eden first book indeed primordial power simplicity myth set rich farmland californias salinas valley sprawling often brutal novel follows intertwined destinies two familiesthe trasks hamiltonswhose generations helplessly reenact fall adam eve poisonous rivalry cain abeladam trask came california east farm raise family new rich land birth twins cal aaron brings wife brink madness adam left alone raise boys manhood one boy thrives nurtured love around grows loneliness enveloped mysterious darknessfirst published east eden work steinbeck created mesmerizing characters explored enduring themes mystery identity inexplicability love murderous consequences loves absence masterpiece steinbecks later years east eden powerful vastly ambitious novel family saga modern retelling book genesisjacket flapeast edenjohn steinbeckeast edenjohn steinbeck
Cloud Atlas,David Mitchell,4.01,"A postmodern visionary who is also a master of styles of genres, David Mitchell combines flat-out adventure, a Nabokovian lore of puzzles, a keen eye for character, and a taste for mind-bending philosophical and scientific speculation in the tradition of Umberto Eco, Haruki Murakami, and Philip K. Dick. The result is brilliantly original fiction as profund as it is playful. Now in his new novel, David Mitchell explores with daring artistry fundamental questions of reality and identity.Cloud Atlas begins in 1850 with Adam Ewing, an American notary voyaging from the Chatham Isles to his home in California. Along the way, Ewing is befriended by a physician, Dr. Goose, who begins to treat him for a rare species of brain parasite. . . .Abruptly, the action jumps to Belgium in 1931, where Robert Frobisher, a disinherited bisexual composer, contrives his way into the household of an infirm maestro who has a beguiling wife and a nubile daughter. . . . From there we jump to the West Coast in the 1970s and a troubled reporter named Luisa Rey, who stumbles upon a web of corporate greed and murder that threatens to claim her life. . . . And onward, with dazzling virtuosity, to an inglorious present-day England; to a Korean superstate of the near future where neocapitalism has run amok; and, finally, to a postapocalyptic Iron Age Hawaii in the last days of history.But the story doesn’t end even there. The narrative then boomerangs back through centuries and space, returning by the same route, in reverse, to its starting point. Along the way, Mitchell reveals how his disparate characters connect, how their fates intertwine, and how their souls drift across time like clouds across the sky.As wild as a videogame, as mysterious as a Zen koan, Cloud Atlas is an unforgettable tour de force that, like its incomparable author, has transcended its cult classic status to become a worldwide phenomenon.Cloud AtlasDavid MitchellCloud AtlasDavid Mitchell",English,"['Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Historical Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Contemporary', 'Novels', 'Literary Fiction', 'Literature', 'Historical']",509,Random House,08/17/04,216149,91.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1563042852l/49628._SX318_.jpg,postmodern visionary also master styles genres david mitchell combines flatout adventure nabokovian lore puzzles keen eye character taste mindbending philosophical scientific speculation tradition umberto eco haruki murakami philip k dick result brilliantly original fiction profund playful new novel david mitchell explores daring artistry fundamental questions reality identitycloud atlas begins adam ewing american notary voyaging chatham isles home california along way ewing befriended physician dr goose begins treat rare species brain parasite abruptly action jumps belgium robert frobisher disinherited bisexual composer contrives way household infirm maestro beguiling wife nubile daughter jump west coast troubled reporter named luisa rey stumbles upon web corporate greed murder threatens claim life onward dazzling virtuosity inglorious presentday england korean superstate near future neocapitalism run amok finally postapocalyptic iron age hawaii last days historybut story doesnt end even narrative boomerangs back centuries space returning route reverse starting point along way mitchell reveals disparate characters connect fates intertwine souls drift across time like clouds across skyas wild videogame mysterious zen koan cloud atlas unforgettable tour de force like incomparable author transcended cult classic status become worldwide phenomenoncloud atlasdavid mitchellcloud atlasdavid mitchell

Now, he’s sure he’ll be the first person to die there.After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he’s alive—and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive.

"Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience and Redemption",Laura Hillenbrand,4.36,"
  In her long-awaited new book, Laura Hillenbrand writes with the same rich and vivid narrative voice she displayed in Seabiscuit. Telling an unforgettable story of a man's journey into extremity, Unbroken is a testament to the resilience of the human mind, body, and spirit.
On a May afternoon in 1943, an Army Air Forces bomber crashed into the Pacific Ocean and disappeared, leaving only a spray of debris and a slick of oil, gasoline, and blood. Then, on the ocean surface, a face appeared. It was that of a young lieutenant, the plane's bombardier, who was struggling to a life raft and pulling himself aboard. So began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the Second World War.The lieutenant’s name was Louis Zamperini. In boyhood, he'd been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent, breaking into houses, brawling, and fleeing his home to ride the rails. As a teenager, he had channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile. But when war had come, the athlete had become an airman, embarking on a journey that led to his doomed flight, a tiny raft, and a drift into the unknown.Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, a foundering raft, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance, Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope, resolve, and humor; brutality with rebellion. His fate, whether triumph or tragedy, would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will.Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience and RedemptionLaura HillenbrandUnbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience and RedemptionLaura Hillenbrand",English,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Biography', 'World War II', 'War', 'Historical', 'Audiobook', 'Military Fiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography Memoir']",492,Random House,11/16/10,767063,95.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327861115l/8664353.jpg,longawaited new book laura hillenbrand writes rich vivid narrative voice displayed seabiscuit telling unforgettable story mans journey extremity unbroken testament resilience human mind body spirit may afternoon army air forces bomber crashed pacific ocean disappeared leaving spray debris slick oil gasoline blood ocean surface face appeared young lieutenant planes bombardier struggling life raft pulling aboard began one extraordinary odysseys second world warthe lieutenants name louis zamperini boyhood hed cunning incorrigible delinquent breaking houses brawling fleeing home ride rails teenager channeled defiance running discovering prodigious talent carried berlin olympics within sight fourminute mile war come athlete become airman embarking journey led doomed flight tiny raft drift unknownahead zamperini lay thousands miles open ocean leaping sharks foundering raft thirst starvation enemy aircraft beyond trial even greater driven limits endurance zamperini would answer desperation ingenuity suffering hope resolve humor brutality rebellion fate whether triumph tragedy would suspended fraying wire willunbroken world war ii story survival resilience redemptionlaura hillenbrandunbroken world war ii story survival resilience redemptionlaura hillenbrand

In the aftermath, the town's residents must not only seek justice in order to begin healing but also come to terms with the role they played in the tragedy. For them, the lines between truth and fiction, right and wrong, insider and outsider have been obscured forever. Josie Cormier, the teenage daughter of the judge sitting on the case, could be the state's best witness, but she can't remember what happened in front of her own eyes. And as the trial progresses, fault lines between the high school and the adult community begin to show, destroying the closest of friendships and families. Nineteen Minutes is New York Times bestselling author Jodi Picoult's most raw, honest, and important novel yet. Told with the straightforward style for which she has become known, it asks simple questions that have no easy answers: Can your own child become a mystery to you? What does it mean to be different in our society? Is it ever okay for a victim to strike back? And who -- if anyone -- has the right to judge someone else?Nineteen MinutesJodi Picoult (Goodreads Author)Nineteen MinutesJodi Picoult (Goodreads Author)",English,"['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Chick Lit', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Drama', 'Young Adult', 'Realistic Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Crime']",440,Atria Books,03/05/07,300559,95.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348577596l/14866.jpg,nineteen minutes mow front lawn color hair watch third hockey game nineteen minutes bake scones get tooth filled dentist fold laundry family fivein nineteen minutes stop world jump nineteen minutes get revenge sterling small ordinary new hampshire town nothing ever happens day complacency shattered shocking act violence aftermath towns residents must seek justice order begin healing also come terms role played tragedy lines truth fiction right wrong insider outsider obscured forever josie cormier teenage daughter judge sitting case could states best witness cant remember happened front eyes trial progresses fault lines high school adult community begin show destroying closest friendships families nineteen minutes new york times bestselling author jodi picoults raw honest important novel yet told straightforward style become known asks simple questions easy answers child become mystery mean different society ever okay victim strike back anyone right judge someone elsenineteen minutesjodi picoult goodreads authornineteen minutesjodi picoult goodreads author

But Daenerys has thousands of enemies, and many have set out to find her. As they gather, one young man embarks upon his own quest for the queen, with an entirely different goal in mind.Fleeing from Westeros with a price on his head, Tyrion Lannister, too, is making his way to Daenerys. But his newest allies in this quest are not the rag-tag band they seem, and at their heart lies one who could undo Daenerys’s claim to Westeros forever.Meanwhile, to the north lies the mammoth Wall of ice and stone—a structure only as strong as those guarding it. There, Jon Snow, 998th Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch, will face his greatest challenge. For he has powerful foes not only within the Watch but also beyond, in the land of the creatures of ice.From all corners, bitter conflicts reignite, intimate betrayals are perpetrated, and a grand cast of outlaws and priests, soldiers and skinchangers, nobles and slaves, will face seemingly insurmountable obstacles.

Coraline,"Neil Gaiman (Goodreads Author), Dave McKean (illustrator)",4.06,"The day after they moved in, Coraline went exploring....In Coraline's family's new flat are twenty-one windows and fourteen doors. Thirteen of the doors open and close. The fourteenth is locked, and on the other side is only a brick wall, until the day Coraline unlocks the door to find a passage to another flat in another house just like her own. Only it's different. At first, things seem marvelous in the other flat. The food is better. The toy box is filled with wind-up angels that flutter around the bedroom, books whose pictures writhe and crawl and shimmer, little dinosaur skulls that chatter their teeth. But there's another mother, and another father, and they want Coraline to stay with them and be their little girl. They want to change her and never let her go. Other children are trapped there as well, lost souls behind the mirrors. Coraline is their only hope of rescue. She will have to fight with all her wits and all the tools she can find if she is to save the lost children, her ordinary life, and herself.

World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War,Max Brooks (Goodreads Author),4.01,"The Zombie War came unthinkably close to eradicating humanity. Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. World War Z is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War.Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, ""By excluding the human factor, aren't we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn't the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as 'the living dead'?""Note: Some of the numerical and factual material contained in this edition was previously published under the auspices of the United Nations Postwar Commission.World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie WarMax Brooks (Goodreads Author)World War ZWorld War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie WarMax Brooks (Goodreads Author)World War Z",English,"['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Zombies', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Dystopia', 'Audiobook', 'Apocalyptic', 'War']",342,Crown,09/12/06,439825,92.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1528312647l/8908._SX318_.jpg,zombie war came unthinkably close eradicating humanity max brooks driven urgency preserving acidetched firsthand experiences survivors apocalyptic years traveled across united states america throughout world decimated cities teemed upwards thirty million souls remote inhospitable areas planet recorded testimony men women sometimes children came facetoface living least undead hell dreadful time world war z result never access document powerfully conveys depth fear horror also ineradicable spirit resistance gripped human society plague yearsranging infamous village new dachang united federation china epidemiological trail began twelveyearold patient zero unnamed northern forests untold numbers sought terrible temporary refuge cold united states southern africa redeker plan provided hope humanity unspeakable price westoftherockies redoubt north american tide finally started turn invaluable chronicle reflects full scope duration zombie warmost book captures haunting immediacy human dimension epochal event facing often raw vivid nature personal accounts requires degree courage part reader effort invaluable mr brooks says introduction excluding human factor arent risking kind personal detachment history may heaven forbid lead us one day repeat end isnt human factor true difference us enemy refer living deadnote numerical factual material contained edition previously published auspices united nations postwar commissionworld war z oral history zombie warmax brooks goodreads authorworld war zworld war z oral history zombie warmax brooks goodreads authorworld war z

A Discovery of Witches,Deborah Harkness (Goodreads Author),4.0,"A richly inventive novel about a centuries-old vampire, a spellbound witch, and the mysterious manuscript that draws them together. Deep in the stacks of Oxford's Bodleian Library, young scholar Diana Bishop unwittingly calls up a bewitched alchemical manuscript in the course of her research. Descended from an old and distinguished line of witches, Diana wants nothing to do with sorcery; so after a furtive glance and a few notes, she banishes the book to the stacks. But her discovery sets a fantastical underworld stirring, and a horde of daemons, witches, and vampires soon descends upon the library. Diana has stumbled upon a coveted treasure lost for centuries-and she is the only creature who can break its spell. Debut novelist Deborah Harkness has crafted a mesmerizing and addictive read, equal parts history and magic, romance and suspense. Diana is a bold heroine who meets her equal in vampire geneticist Matthew Clairmont, and gradually warms up to him as their alliance deepens into an intimacy that violates age-old taboos. This smart, sophisticated story harks back to the novels of Anne Rice, but it is as contemporary and sensual as the Twilight series-with an extra serving of historical realism.A Discovery of WitchesDeborah Harkness (Goodreads Author)All Souls Trilogy #1A Discovery of WitchesDeborah Harkness (Goodreads Author)All Souls Trilogy #1",English,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Paranormal', 'Vampires', 'Witches', 'Magic', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Paranormal Romance', 'Supernatural']",579,Viking Penguin,02/28/11,369030,90.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1525097370l/8667848._SY475_.jpg,richly inventive novel centuriesold vampire spellbound witch mysterious manuscript draws together deep stacks oxfords bodleian library young scholar diana bishop unwittingly calls bewitched alchemical manuscript course research descended old distinguished line witches diana wants nothing sorcery furtive glance notes banishes book stacks discovery sets fantastical underworld stirring horde daemons witches vampires soon descends upon library diana stumbled upon coveted treasure lost centuriesand creature break spell debut novelist deborah harkness crafted mesmerizing addictive read equal parts history magic romance suspense diana bold heroine meets equal vampire geneticist matthew clairmont gradually warms alliance deepens intimacy violates ageold taboos smart sophisticated story harks back novels anne rice contemporary sensual twilight serieswith extra serving historical realisma discovery witchesdeborah harkness goodreads authorall souls trilogy discovery witchesdeborah harkness goodreads authorall souls trilogy

Using the pseudonym of ""Dr. Seuss"" (Seuss was Geisel's middle name) and only two hundred twenty-three words, Geisel created a replacement for those dull primers: ""The Cat in the Hat."" The instant success of the book prompted Geisel and his wife to found Beginner Books, and Geisel wrote many popular books in this series, including ""Hop on Pop,"" ""Fox in Socks,"" and ""Green Eggs and Ham."" Other favorite titles in this series are ""Go, Dog, Go!"" and ""Are You My Mother?"" by P. D. Eastman, ""A Fly Went By,"" by Mike McClintock, and ""Put Me in the Zoo,"" by Robert Lopshire.

Persuasion,"Jane Austen, Deidre Shauna Lynch (Introduction), James Kinsley (Editor)",4.14,"Twenty-seven-year old Anne Elliot is Austen's most adult heroine. Eight years before the story proper begins, she is happily betrothed to a naval officer, Frederick Wentworth, but she precipitously breaks off the engagement when persuaded by her friend Lady Russell that such a match is unworthy. The breakup produces in Anne a deep and long-lasting regret. When later Wentworth returns from sea a rich and successful captain, he finds Anne's family on the brink of financial ruin and his own sister a tenant in Kellynch Hall, the Elliot estate. All the tension of the novel revolves around one question: Will Anne and Wentworth be reunited in their love?Jane Austen once compared her writing to painting on a little bit of ivory, 2 inches square.

The Last Lecture,Randy Pausch,4.26,"A lot of professors give talks titled 'The Last Lecture'. Professors are asked to consider their demise and to ruminate on what matters most to them: What wisdom would we impart to the world if we knew it was our last chance? If we had to vanish tomorrow, what would we want as our legacy?When Randy Pausch, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, was asked to give such a lecture, he didn't have to imagine it as his last, since he had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. But the lecture he gave, 'Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams', wasn't about dying. It was about the importance of overcoming obstacles, of enabling the dreams of others, of seizing every moment (because time is all you have and you may find one day that you have less than you think). It was a summation of everything Randy had come to believe. It was about living.In this book, Randy Pausch has combined the humour, inspiration, and intelligence that made his lecture such a phenomenon and given it an indelible form. It is a book that will be shared for generations to come.The Last LectureRandy PauschThe Last LectureRandy Pausch",English,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Inspirational', 'Self Help', 'Philosophy', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Adult']",217,Hachette Books,04/11/08,302783,95.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1529682044l/40611510._SX318_.jpg,lot professors give talks titled last lecture professors asked consider demise ruminate matters wisdom would impart world knew last chance vanish tomorrow would want legacywhen randy pausch computer science professor carnegie mellon asked give lecture didnt imagine last since recently diagnosed terminal cancer lecture gave really achieving childhood dreams wasnt dying importance overcoming obstacles enabling dreams others seizing every moment time may find one day less think summation everything randy come believe livingin book randy pausch combined humour inspiration intelligence made lecture phenomenon given indelible form book shared generations comethe last lecturerandy pauschthe last lecturerandy pausch

I'm a sidhe-seer, one who sees the Fae, a fact I accepted only recently and very reluctantly.My philosophy is pretty simple - any day nobody's trying to kill me is a good day in my book.

But then, there's not a sidhe-seer alive who's had a good day since then.""When MacKayla's sister was murdered, she left a single clue to her death, a cryptic message on Mac's cell phone.

A Brief History of Time,Stephen Hawking,4.18,"In the ten years since its publication in 1988, Stephen Hawking's classic work has become a landmark volume in scientific writing, with more than nine million copies in forty languages sold worldwide. That edition was on the cutting edge of what was then known about the origins and nature of the universe. But the intervening years have seen extraordinary advances in the technology of observing both the micro- and the macrocosmic worlds. These observations have confirmed many of Professor Hawking's theoretical predictions in the first edition of his book, including the recent discoveries of the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE), which probed back in time to within 300,000 years of the universe's beginning and revealed wrinkles in the fabric of space-time that he had projected. Eager to bring to his original text the new knowledge revealed by these observations, as well as his own recent research, Professor Hawking has prepared a new introduction to the book, written an entirely new chapter on wormholes and time travel, and updated the chapters throughout.A Brief History of TimeStephen HawkingA Brief History of TimeStephen Hawking",English,"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Physics', 'History', 'Astronomy', 'Philosophy', 'Classics', 'Popular Science', 'Space', 'Audiobook']",212,Bantam Books,09/01/98,303285,95.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1333578746l/3869.jpg,ten years since publication stephen hawkings classic work become landmark volume scientific writing nine million copies forty languages sold worldwide edition cutting edge known origins nature universe intervening years seen extraordinary advances technology observing micro macrocosmic worlds observations confirmed many professor hawkings theoretical predictions first edition book including recent discoveries cosmic background explorer satellite cobe probed back time within years universes beginning revealed wrinkles fabric spacetime projected eager bring original text new knowledge revealed observations well recent research professor hawking prepared new introduction book written entirely new chapter wormholes time travel updated chapters throughouta brief history timestephen hawkinga brief history timestephen hawking

When a German captain requisitions Vianne’s home, she and her daughter must live with the enemy or lose everything. Without food or money or hope, as danger escalates all around them, she is forced to make one impossible choice after another to keep her family alive.Vianne’s sister, Isabelle, is a rebellious eighteen-year-old, searching for purpose with all the reckless passion of youth.

But when he betrays her, Isabelle joins the Resistance and never looks back, risking her life time and again to save others.With courage, grace and powerful insight, bestselling author Kristin Hannah captures the epic panorama of World War II and illuminates an intimate part of history seldom seen: the women’s war.

The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals,Michael Pollan (Goodreads Author),4.17,"What should we have for dinner? For omnivore's like ourselves, this simple question has always posed a dilemma: When you can eat just about anything nature (or the supermarket) has to offer, deciding what you should eat will inevitably stir anxiety, especially when some of the foods on offer might shorten your life. Today, buffeted by one food fad after another, America is suffering from what can only be described as a national eating disorder. The omnivore's dilemma has returned with a vengeance, as the cornucopia of the modern American supermarket and fast-food outlet confronts us with a bewildering and treacherous food landscape. What's at stake in our eating choices is not only our own and our children's health, but the health of the environment that sustains life on earth.The Omnivore's Dilemma is a groundbreaking book in which one of America's most fascinating, original, and elegant writers turns his own omnivorous mind to the seemingly straightforward question of what we should have for dinner. The question has confronted us since man discovered fire, but, according to Michael Pollan, the bestselling author of The Botany of Desire, how we answer it today, ath the dawn of the twenty-first century, may well determine our very survival as a species. Should we eat a fast-food hamburger? Something organic> Or perhaps something we hunt, gather or grow ourselves?To find out, Pollan follows each of the food chains that sustain us--industrial food, organic or alternative food, and food we forage ourselves--from the source to a final meal, and in the process develops a definitive account of the American way of eating. His absorbing narrative takes us from Iowa cornfields to food laboratories, from feedlots and fast-food restaurants to organic farms and hunting grounds, always emphasizing our dynamic coevolutionary relationship with the handful of plant and animal species we depend on. Each time Pollan sits down to a meal, he deploys his unique blend of personal and investigative journalism to trace the origins of everything consumed, revealing what we unwittingly ingest and explaining how our taste for particular foods and flavors reflects our evolutionary inheritance.The surprising answers Pollan offers to the simple question posed by this book have profound political, economic, psychological, and even mortal implications for all of us. Ultimately, this is a book as much about visionary solutions as it is about problems, and Pollan contends that, when it comes to food, doing the right thing often turns out to be the tastiest thing an eater can do. Beautifully written and thrillingly argued, The Omnivore's Dilemma promises to change the way we think about the politics and pleasure of eating.

The Namesake,Jhumpa Lahiri,4.0,"Jhumpa Lahiri's Interpreter of Maladies established this young writer as one the most brilliant of her generation. Her stories are one of the very few debut works -- and only a handful of collections -- to have won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Among the many other awards and honors it received were the New Yorker Debut of the Year award, the PEN/Hemingway Award, and the highest critical praise for its grace, acuity, and compassion in detailing lives transported from India to America.In The Namesake, Lahiri enriches the themes that made her collection an international bestseller: the immigrant experience, the clash of cultures, the conflicts of assimilation, and, most poignantly, the tangled ties between generations. Here again Lahiri displays her deft touch for the perfect detail — the fleeting moment, the turn of phrase — that opens whole worlds of emotion.The Namesake takes the Ganguli family from their tradition-bound life in Calcutta through their fraught transformation into Americans. On the heels of their arranged wedding, Ashoke and Ashima Ganguli settle together in Cambridge, Massachusetts. An engineer by training, Ashoke adapts far less warily than his wife, who resists all things American and pines for her family. When their son is born, the task of naming him betrays the vexed results of bringing old ways to the new world. Named for a Russian writer by his Indian parents in memory of a catastrophe years before, Gogol Ganguli knows only that he suffers the burden of his heritage as well as his odd, antic name. Lahiri brings great empathy to Gogol as he stumbles along the first-generation path, strewn with conflicting loyalties, comic detours, and wrenching love affairs. With penetrating insight, she reveals not only the defining power of the names and expectations bestowed upon us by our parents, but also the means by which we slowly, sometimes painfully, come to define ourselves.The NamesakeJhumpa LahiriThe NamesakeJhumpa Lahiri",English,"['Fiction', 'India', 'Contemporary', 'Literary Fiction', 'Novels', 'Indian Literature', 'Literature', 'Book Club', 'Adult Fiction', 'Adult']",291,Mariner Books,09/01/04,233553,95.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1480106986l/33917._SY475_.jpg,jhumpa lahiris interpreter maladies established young writer one brilliant generation stories one debut works handful collections pulitzer prize fiction among many awards honors received new yorker debut year award penhemingway award highest critical praise grace acuity compassion detailing lives transported india americain namesake lahiri enriches themes made collection international bestseller immigrant experience clash cultures conflicts assimilation poignantly tangled ties generations lahiri displays deft touch perfect detail fleeting moment turn phrase opens whole worlds emotionthe namesake takes ganguli family traditionbound life calcutta fraught transformation americans heels arranged wedding ashoke ashima ganguli settle together cambridge massachusetts engineer training ashoke adapts far less warily wife resists things american pines family son born task naming betrays vexed results bringing old ways new world named russian writer indian parents memory catastrophe years gogol ganguli knows suffers burden heritage well odd antic name lahiri brings great empathy gogol stumbles along firstgeneration path strewn conflicting loyalties comic detours wrenching love affairs penetrating insight reveals defining power names expectations bestowed upon us parents also means slowly sometimes painfully come define ourselvesthe namesakejhumpa lahirithe namesakejhumpa lahiri

The Ocean at the End of the Lane,Neil Gaiman (Goodreads Author),4.0,"Sussex, England. A middle-aged man returns to his childhood home to attend a funeral. Although the house he lived in is long gone, he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother. He hasn't thought of Lettie in decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse, the unremembered past comes flooding back. And it is a past too strange, too frightening, too dangerous to have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy.Forty years earlier, a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road. Like a fuse on a firework, his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable ways. The darkness was unleashed, something scary and thoroughly incomprehensible to a little boy. And Lettie—magical, comforting, wise beyond her years—promised to protect him, no matter what.A groundbreaking work from a master, The Ocean at the End of the Lane is told with a rare understanding of all that makes us human, and shows the power of stories to reveal and shelter us from the darkness inside and out. It is a stirring, terrifying, and elegiac fable as delicate as a butterfly's wing and as menacing as a knife in the dark.The Ocean at the End of the LaneNeil Gaiman (Goodreads Author)The Ocean at the End of the LaneNeil Gaiman (Goodreads Author)",English,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Horror', 'Magical Realism', 'Audiobook', 'Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adult Fiction', 'Paranormal']",181,William Morrow Books,06/18/13,480713,93.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1497098563l/15783514._SY475_.jpg,sussex england middleaged man returns childhood home attend funeral although house lived long gone drawn farm end road seven encountered remarkable girl lettie hempstock mother grandmother hasnt thought lettie decades yet sits pond pond shed claimed ocean behind ramshackle old farmhouse unremembered past comes flooding back past strange frightening dangerous happened anyone let alone small boyforty years earlier man committed suicide stolen car farm end road like fuse firework death lit touchpaper resonated unimaginable ways darkness unleashed something scary thoroughly incomprehensible little boy lettiemagical comforting wise beyond yearspromised protect matter whata groundbreaking work master ocean end lane told rare understanding makes us human shows power stories reveal shelter us darkness inside stirring terrifying elegiac fable delicate butterflys wing menacing knife darkthe ocean end laneneil gaiman goodreads authorthe ocean end laneneil gaiman goodreads author
The Passage,"Justin Cronin (Goodreads Author), Dominique Haas (Traduction)",4.03,"IT HAPPENED FAST.THIRTY-TWO MINUTES FOR ONE WORLD TO DIE, ANOTHER TO BE BORN.First, the unthinkable: a security breach at a secret U.S. government facility unleashes the monstrous product of a chilling military experiment. Then, the unspeakable: a night of chaos and carnage gives way to sunrise on a nation, and ultimately a world, forever altered. All that remains for the stunned survivors is the long fight ahead and a future ruled by fear--of darkness, of death, of a fate far worse.As civilization swiftly crumbles into a primal landscape of predators and prey, two people flee in search of sanctuary. FBI agent Brad Wolgast is a good man haunted by what he's done in the line of duty. Six-year-old orphan Amy Harper Bellafonte is a refugee from the doomed scientific project that has triggered apocalypse. Wolgast is determined to protect her from the horror set loose by her captors, but for Amy, escaping the bloody fallout is only the beginning of a much longer odyssey--spanning miles and decades--toward the time an place where she must finish what should never have begun.With The Passage, award-winning author Justin Cronin has written both a relentlessly suspenseful adventure and an epic chronicle of human endurance in the face of unprecedented catastrophe and unimaginable danger. Its inventive storytelling, masterly prose, and depth of human insight mark it as a crucial and transcendent work of modern fiction.(front flap)The PassageJustin Cronin (Goodreads Author), Dominique Haas (Traduction)The Passage #1The PassageJustin Cronin (Goodreads Author), Dominique Haas (Traduction)The Passage #1",English,"['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Vampires', 'Dystopia', 'Thriller', 'Apocalyptic', 'Paranormal']",766,Ballantine Books,06/08/10,188649,92.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327874267l/6690798.jpg,happened fastthirtytwo minutes one world die another bornfirst unthinkable security breach secret us government facility unleashes monstrous product chilling military experiment unspeakable night chaos carnage gives way sunrise nation ultimately world forever altered remains stunned survivors long fight ahead future ruled fearof darkness death fate far worseas civilization swiftly crumbles primal landscape predators prey two people flee search sanctuary fbi agent brad wolgast good man haunted hes done line duty sixyearold orphan amy harper bellafonte refugee doomed scientific project triggered apocalypse wolgast determined protect horror set loose captors amy escaping bloody fallout beginning much longer odysseyspanning miles decadestoward time place must finish never begunwith passage awardwinning author justin cronin written relentlessly suspenseful adventure epic chronicle human endurance face unprecedented catastrophe unimaginable danger inventive storytelling masterly prose depth human insight mark crucial transcendent work modern fictionfront flapthe passagejustin cronin goodreads author dominique haas traductionthe passage passagejustin cronin goodreads author dominique haas traductionthe passage

The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change,"Stephen R. Covey, Jim Collins (Foreward, Contributor)",4.12,"When Stephen Covey first released The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, the book became an instant rage because people suddenly got up and took notice that their lives were headed off in the wrong direction; and more than that, they realized that there were so many simple things they could do in order to navigate their life correctly. This book was wonderful education for people, education in how to live life effectively and get closer to the ideal of being a ‘success’ in life.But not everyone understands Stephen Covey’s model fully well, or maybe there are some people who haven’t read it yet. This is definitely true because we still see so much failure all around us. Now, I am not saying that by using Covey’s model, or anyone else’s model for that matter, you can become a sure-shot success, but at least we should have seen many more successes around us already judging by the number of copies the book has sold! So, where is the shortcoming?There are two main problems here, and we are talking only about the people who have read the book already. The first problem is that most people are too lazy to implement the ideals of Stephen Covey in their lives. They consider his masterpiece of a book as a mere coffee-table book or a book that you use for light reading when you are traveling and then forget all about it. They do not realize that this book contains life-changing information. Or, they take the information and do not make the effort to actually utilize it so that it becomes knowledge for them.The second problem is that a lot of people have a myopic view of Covey’s ideals. These are people who are impressed by the book already. If you ask them what the seven habits are, they can rattle them off end to end, but then they miss the larger picture. They do not understand that Covey was trying to tell more than he wrote in words. There are hidden implications in this book, yes, and a lot of people have just failed to see through them.That is what we are trying to do. We are trying to show you how Covey’s book, or rather, his model, was a complete model in itself. There was nothing amiss about it. If you implement it, there should be no aspect of your life that should go untouched. The only thing is that you have to understand these ideals and try to implement them in your life.But, before we barge into that area, it is extremely important to understand what these ideals are. What was the model that was propounded by Stephen Covey in his mega-famous book? We shall begin by trying to understand his model first, and then interpret it in such a way that it pertains to every aspect of our lifeThe 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal ChangeStephen R.

The Glass Castle,Jeannette Walls,4.28,"A tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that, despite its profound flaws, gave the author the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms.Jeannette Walls grew up with parents whose ideals and stubborn nonconformity were both their curse and their salvation. Rex and Rose Mary Walls had four children. In the beginning, they lived like nomads, moving among Southwest desert towns, camping in the mountains. Rex was a charismatic, brilliant man who, when sober, captured his children's imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and above all, how to embrace life fearlessly. Rose Mary, who painted and wrote and couldn't stand the responsibility of providing for her family, called herself an ""excitement addict."" Cooking a meal that would be consumed in fifteen minutes had no appeal when she could make a painting that might last forever. Later, when the money ran out, or the romance of the wandering life faded, the Walls retreated to the dismal West Virginia mining town -- and the family -- Rex Walls had done everything he could to escape. He drank. He stole the grocery money and disappeared for days. As the dysfunction of the family escalated, Jeannette and her brother and sisters had to fend for themselves, supporting one another as they weathered their parents' betrayals and, finally, found the resources and will to leave home. What is so astonishing about Jeannette Walls is not just that she had the guts and tenacity and intelligence to get out, but that she describes her parents with such deep affection and generosity. Hers is a story of triumph against all odds, but also a tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that despite its profound flaws gave her the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms. For two decades, Jeannette Walls hid her roots. Now she tells her own story.The Glass CastleJeannette WallsThe Glass CastleJeannette Walls",English,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Autobiography', 'Biography Memoir', 'Book Club', 'Adult', 'Audiobook', 'Contemporary', 'School']",288,Scribner,January 17th 2006,903463,96.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1523542886l/7445._SY475_.jpg,tender moving tale unconditional love family despite profound flaws gave author fiery determination carve successful life termsjeannette walls grew parents whose ideals stubborn nonconformity curse salvation rex rose mary walls four children beginning lived like nomads moving among southwest desert towns camping mountains rex charismatic brilliant man sober captured childrens imagination teaching physics geology embrace life fearlessly rose mary painted wrote couldnt stand responsibility providing family called excitement addict cooking meal would consumed fifteen minutes appeal could make painting might last forever later money ran romance wandering life faded walls retreated dismal west virginia mining town family rex walls done everything could escape drank stole grocery money disappeared days dysfunction family escalated jeannette brother sisters fend supporting one another weathered parents betrayals finally found resources leave home astonishing jeannette walls guts tenacity intelligence get describes parents deep affection generosity story triumph odds also tender moving tale unconditional love family despite profound flaws gave fiery determination carve successful life terms two decades jeannette walls hid roots tells storythe glass castlejeannette wallsthe glass castlejeannette walls

Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,Yuval Noah Harari,4.42,"100,000 years ago, at least six human species inhabited the earth. Today there is just one. Us. Homo sapiens. How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods, nations and human rights; to trust money, books and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? In Sapiens, Dr Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical – and sometimes devastating – breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, paleontology and economics, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors? And what, if anything, can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come? Bold, wide-ranging and provocative, Sapiens challenges everything we thought we knew about being human: our thoughts, our actions, our power ... and our future.Sapiens: A Brief History of HumankindYuval Noah HarariSapiens: A Brief History of HumankindYuval Noah Harari",English,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Science', 'Philosophy', 'Anthropology', 'Audiobook', 'Sociology', 'Historical', 'Psychology', 'Evolution']",498,Harvill Secker,2014,502425,96.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1595674533l/23692271._SY475_.jpg,years ago least six human species inhabited earth today one us homo sapiens species succeed battle dominance foraging ancestors come together create cities kingdoms come believe gods nations human rights trust money books laws enslaved bureaucracy timetables consumerism world like millennia come sapiens dr yuval noah harari spans whole human history first humans walk earth radical sometimes devastating breakthroughs cognitive agricultural scientific revolutions drawing insights biology anthropology paleontology economics explores currents history shaped human societies animals plants around us even personalities become happier history unfolded ever free behaviour heritage ancestors anything influence course centuries come bold wideranging provocative sapiens challenges everything thought knew human thoughts actions power futuresapiens brief history humankindyuval noah hararisapiens brief history humankindyuval noah harari

Call Me By Your Name,André Aciman (Goodreads Author),4.23,"Call Me by Your Name is the story of a sudden and powerful romance that blossoms between an adolescent boy and a summer guest at his parents' cliff-side mansion on the Italian Riviera. Unprepared for the consequences of their attraction, at first each feigns indifference. But during the restless summer weeks that follow, unrelenting buried currents of obsession and fear, fascination and desire, intensify their passion as they test the charged ground between them. What grows from the depths of their spirits is a romance of scarcely six weeks' duration and an experience that marks them for a lifetime. For what the two discover on the Riviera and during a sultry evening in Rome is the one thing both already fear they may never truly find again: total intimacy. The psychological maneuvers that accompany attraction have seldom been more shrewdly captured than in André Aciman's frank, unsentimental, heartrending elegy to human passion. Call Me by Your Name is clear-eyed, bare-knuckled, and ultimately unforgettable.Call Me By Your NameAndré Aciman (Goodreads Author)Call Me By Your Name #1Call Me By Your NameAndré Aciman (Goodreads Author)Call Me By Your Name #1",English,"['Fiction', 'Romance', 'LGBT', 'Contemporary', 'Queer', 'Audiobook', 'Adult', 'Gay', 'Coming Of Age', 'M M Romance']",248,Atlantic Books,September 21st 2017,210409,94.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1519203520l/36336078._SY475_.jpg,call name story sudden powerful romance blossoms adolescent boy summer guest parents cliffside mansion italian riviera unprepared consequences attraction first feigns indifference restless summer weeks follow unrelenting buried currents obsession fear fascination desire intensify passion test charged ground grows depths spirits romance scarcely six weeks duration experience marks lifetime two discover riviera sultry evening rome one thing already fear may never truly find total intimacy psychological maneuvers accompany attraction seldom shrewdly captured andr acimans frank unsentimental heartrending elegy human passion call name cleareyed bareknuckled ultimately unforgettablecall nameandr aciman goodreads authorcall name call nameandr aciman goodreads authorcall name

Over the decades, their relationships deepen and darken, tinged by addiction, success, and pride. Yet their greatest challenge, each comes to realize, is Jude himself, by midlife a terrifyingly talented litigator yet an increasingly broken man, his mind and body scarred by an unspeakable childhood, and haunted by what he fears is a degree of trauma that he’ll not only be unable to overcome—but that will define his life forever.A Little LifeHanya Yanagihara (Goodreads Author)A Little LifeHanya Yanagihara (Goodreads Author)",English,"['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'LGBT', 'Literary Fiction', 'Adult', 'Novels', 'Adult Fiction', 'Queer', 'Audiobook', 'Literature']",720,Doubleday,March 10th 2015,211560,93.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1446469353l/22822858._SY475_.jpg,brace astonishing challenging upsetting profoundly moving book many season epic love friendship twentyfirst century goes darkest places fiction ever traveled yet somehow improbably breaks light truly amazementand great gift readerswhen four classmates small massachusetts college move new york make way theyre broke adrift buoyed friendship ambition kind handsome willem aspiring actor jb quickwitted sometimes cruel brooklynborn painter seeking entry art world malcolm frustrated architect prominent firm withdrawn brilliant enigmatic jude serves center gravity decades relationships deepen darken tinged addiction success pride yet greatest challenge comes realize jude midlife terrifyingly talented litigator yet increasingly broken man mind body scarred unspeakable childhood haunted fears degree trauma hell unable overcomebut define life forevera little lifehanya yanagihara goodreads authora little lifehanya yanagihara goodreads author

The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,Rebecca Skloot (Goodreads Author),4.07,"Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first “immortal” human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they’d weigh more than 50 million metric tons—as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions.Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the “colored” ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henrietta’s small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia — a land of wooden slave quarters, faith healings, and voodoo — to East Baltimore today, where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells.Henrietta’s family did not learn of her “immortality” until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family — past and present — is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family—especially Henrietta’s daughter Deborah, who was devastated to learn about her mother’s cells. She was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Did it hurt her when researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space? What happened to her sister, Elsie, who died in a mental institution at the age of fifteen? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn’t her children afford health insurance?Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.The Immortal Life of Henrietta LacksRebecca Skloot (Goodreads Author)The Immortal Life of Henrietta LacksRebecca Skloot (Goodreads Author)",English,"['Nonfiction', 'Science', 'History', 'Biography', 'Medicine', 'Audiobook', 'Book Club', 'Medical', 'Biography Memoir', 'Historical']",370,Crown Publishing Group,February 2nd 2010,587187,93.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327878144l/6493208.jpg,name henrietta lacks scientists know hela poor southern tobacco farmer worked land slave ancestors yet cellstaken without knowledgebecame one important tools medicine first immortal human cells grown culture still alive today though dead sixty years could pile hela cells ever grown onto scale theyd weigh million metric tonsas much hundred empire state buildings hela cells vital developing polio vaccine uncovered secrets cancer viruses atom bombs effects helped lead important advances like vitro fertilization cloning gene mapping bought sold billionsyet henrietta lacks remains virtually unknown buried unmarked gravenow rebecca skloot takes us extraordinary journey colored ward johns hopkins hospital stark white laboratories freezers full hela cells henriettas small dying hometown clover virginia land wooden slave quarters faith healings voodoo east baltimore today children grandchildren live struggle legacy cellshenriettas family learn immortality twenty years death scientists investigating hela began using husband children research without informed consent though cells launched multimilliondollar industry sells human biological materials family never saw profits rebecca skloot brilliantly shows story lacks family past present inextricably connected dark history experimentation african americans birth bioethics legal battles whether control stuff made ofover decade took uncover story rebecca became enmeshed lives lacks familyespecially henriettas daughter deborah devastated learn mothers cells consumed questions scientists cloned mother hurt researchers infected cells viruses shot space happened sister elsie died mental institution age fifteen mother important medicine couldnt children afford health insuranceintimate feeling astonishing scope impossible put immortal life henrietta lacks captures beauty drama scientific discovery well human consequencesthe immortal life henrietta lacksrebecca skloot goodreads authorthe immortal life henrietta lacksrebecca skloot goodreads author

He asks the question: what makes high-achievers different?His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like, and too little attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.Outliers: The Story of SuccessMalcolm GladwellOutliers: The Story of SuccessMalcolm Gladwell",English,"['Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Business', 'Self Help', 'Sociology', 'Science', 'Audiobook', 'Personal Development', 'Economics', 'Leadership']",309,"Little, Brown and Company",November 18th 2008,556065,96.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344266315l/3228917.jpg,stunning new book malcolm gladwell takes us intellectual journey world outliersthe best brightest famous successful asks question makes highachievers differenthis answer pay much attention successful people like little attention culture family generation idiosyncratic experiences upbringing along way explains secrets software billionaires takes great soccer player asians good math made beatles greatest rock bandoutliers story successmalcolm gladwelloutliers story successmalcolm gladwell

Abdullah and his sister Pari live with their father and stepmother in the small village of Shadbagh. Their father, Saboor, is constantly in search of work and they struggle together through poverty and brutal winters. To Abdullah, Pari - as beautiful and sweet-natured as the fairy for which she was named - is everything. More like a parent than a brother, Abdullah will do anything for her, even trading his only pair of shoes for a feather for her treasured collection. Each night they sleep together in their cot, their heads touching, their limbs tangled. One day the siblings journey across the desert to Kabul with their father. Pari and Abdullah have no sense of the fate that awaits them there, for the event which unfolds will tear their lives apart; sometimes a finger must be cut to save the hand. Crossing generations and continents, moving from Kabul, to Paris, to San Francisco, to the Greek island of Tinos, with profound wisdom, depth, insight and compassion, Khaled Hosseini writes about the bonds that define us and shape our lives, the ways in which we help our loved ones in need, how the choices we make resonate through history and how we are often surprised by the people closest to us.And the Mountains EchoedKhaled Hosseini (Goodreads Author)And the Mountains EchoedKhaled Hosseini (Goodreads Author)",English,"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Novels', 'Book Club', 'Literary Fiction', 'Historical', 'Drama']",404,Riverhead Books,May 21st 2013,301931,95.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1358190204l/16115612.jpg,want story tell oneafghanistan abdullah sister pari live father stepmother small village shadbagh father saboor constantly search work struggle together poverty brutal winters abdullah pari beautiful sweetnatured fairy named everything like parent brother abdullah anything even trading pair shoes feather treasured collection night sleep together cot heads touching limbs tangled one day siblings journey across desert kabul father pari abdullah sense fate awaits event unfolds tear lives apart sometimes finger must cut save hand crossing generations continents moving kabul paris san francisco greek island tinos profound wisdom depth insight compassion khaled hosseini writes bonds define us shape lives ways help loved ones need choices make resonate history often surprised people closest usand mountains echoedkhaled hosseini goodreads authorand mountains echoedkhaled hosseini goodreads author

The Rescue,Nicholas Sparks (Goodreads Author),4.11,"When confronted by raging fires or deadly accidents, volunteer fireman Taylor McAden feels compelled to take terrifying risks; but there is one leap of faith Taylor can't bring himself to make: He can't fall in love.BookPage calls Nicholas Sparks, ""a modern master of fateful love stories,"" and his phenomenal bestsellers- The Notebook, Message in a Bottle, and A Walk to Remember- have made him one of America's most beloved storytellers. Here, in his newest work, Sparks tells a story about making the greatest commitment of all...loving someone forever. The Rescue When confronted by raging fires or deadly accidents, volunteer fireman Taylor McAden feels compelled to take terrifying risks - risks no one else in the department would ever take - to save lives. But there is one leap of faith Taylor can't bring himself to make: He can't fall in love. For all his adult years, Taylor has sought out women who need to be rescued, women he leaves as soon as their crisis is over, as soon as the relationship starts to become truly intimate. Then, one day, a raging, record-breaking storm hits his small Southern town. Denise Holton, a young single mother, is driving through it when her car skids off the road. With her is her four-year-old son, Kyle, a boy with severe learning disabilities and for whom she has sacrificed everything. Unconscious and bleeding, she-but not Kyle-will be found by Taylor McAden. And when she wakes, the chilling truth becomes clear to both of them: Kyle is gone. During the search for Kyle, the connection, the lifeline, between Taylor and Denise takes root. Taylor doesn't know that this rescue will be different from all the others, demanding far more than raw physical courage. That it will lead him to the possibility of his own rescue from a life lived without love. That it will require him to open doors to his past that were slammed shut by pain. That it will dare him to live life to the fullest by daring to love. In The Rescue Nicholas Sparks weaves his inimitable spell, immersing us in the passions and the surprising complexities of modern relationships-and in doing so, teaching us something about our own.The RescueNicholas Sparks (Goodreads Author)The RescueNicholas Sparks (Goodreads Author)",English,"['Romance', 'Fiction', 'Chick Lit', 'Contemporary', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Contemporary Romance', 'Love', 'Drama', 'Love Story']",352,Grand Central Publishing,April 1st 2005,167967,95.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1385055753l/3462.jpg,confronted raging fires deadly accidents volunteer fireman taylor mcaden feels compelled take terrifying risks one leap faith taylor cant bring make cant fall lovebookpage calls nicholas sparks modern master fateful love stories phenomenal bestsellers notebook message bottle walk remember made one americas beloved storytellers newest work sparks tells story making greatest commitment allloving someone forever rescue confronted raging fires deadly accidents volunteer fireman taylor mcaden feels compelled take terrifying risks risks one else department would ever take save lives one leap faith taylor cant bring make cant fall love adult years taylor sought women need rescued women leaves soon crisis soon relationship starts become truly intimate one day raging recordbreaking storm hits small southern town denise holton young single mother driving car skids road fouryearold son kyle boy severe learning disabilities sacrificed everything unconscious bleeding shebut kylewill found taylor mcaden wakes chilling truth becomes clear kyle gone search kyle connection lifeline taylor denise takes root taylor doesnt know rescue different others demanding far raw physical courage lead possibility rescue life lived without love require open doors past slammed shut pain dare live life fullest daring love rescue nicholas sparks weaves inimitable spell immersing us passions surprising complexities modern relationshipsand teaching us something ownthe rescuenicholas sparks goodreads authorthe rescuenicholas sparks goodreads author

The Blade Itself,Joe Abercrombie,4.16,"Logen Ninefingers, infamous barbarian, has finally run out of luck. Caught in one feud too many, he’s on the verge of becoming a dead barbarian – leaving nothing behind him but bad songs, dead friends, and a lot of happy enemies. Nobleman Captain Jezal dan Luthar, dashing officer, and paragon of selfishness, has nothing more dangerous in mind than fleecing his friends at cards and dreaming of glory in the fencing circle. But war is brewing, and on the battlefields of the frozen North they fight by altogether bloodier rules. Inquisitor Glokta, cripple turned torturer, would like nothing better than to see Jezal come home in a box. But then Glokta hates everyone: cutting treason out of the Union one confession at a time leaves little room for friendship. His latest trail of corpses may lead him right to the rotten heart of government, if he can stay alive long enough to follow it. Enter the wizard, Bayaz. A bald old man with a terrible temper and a pathetic assistant, he could be the First of the Magi, he could be a spectacular fraud, but whatever he is, he's about to make the lives of Logen, Jezal, and Glokta a whole lot more difficult.

Batman: The Dark Knight Returns,"Frank Miller, Klaus Janson (Illustrator), Lynn Varley (Illustrator)",4.26,"This masterpiece of modern comics storytelling brings to vivid life a dark world and an even darker man. Together with inker Klaus Janson and colorist Lynn Varley, writer/artist Frank Miller completely reinvents the legend of Batman in his saga of a near-future Gotham City gone to rot, ten years after the Dark Knight's retirement.

As civil society crumbles around him, Bruce Wayne's long-suppressed vigilante side finally breaks free of its self-imposed shackles.

He is soon joined by this generation's Robin—a girl named Carrie Kelley, who proves to be just as invaluable as her predecessors.But can Batman and Robin deal with the threat posed by their deadliest enemies, after years of incarceration have made them into perfect psychopaths? And more important, can anyone survive the coming fallout of an undeclared war between the superpowers—or a clash of what were once the world's greatest superheroes?Over fifteen years after its debut, Batman: The Dark Knight Returns remains an undisputed classic and one of the most influential stories ever told in the comics medium.Collecting Batman: The Dark Knight Returns #1-4Batman: The Dark Knight ReturnsFrank Miller, Klaus Janson (Illustrator), Lynn Varley (Illustrator)Batman: The Dark Knight Returns #1-4Batman: The Dark Knight ReturnsFrank Miller, Klaus Janson (Illustrator), Lynn Varley (Illustrator)Batman: The Dark Knight Returns #1-4",English,"['Comics', 'Graphic Novels', 'Batman', 'Fiction', 'Comic Book', 'Graphic Novels Comics', 'Dc Comics', 'Superheroes', 'Fantasy', 'Classics']",197,DC Comics,November 2012,161494,94.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327892039l/59960.jpg,masterpiece modern comics storytelling brings vivid life dark world even darker man together inker klaus janson colorist lynn varley writerartist frank miller completely reinvents legend batman saga nearfuture gotham city gone rot ten years dark knights retirement crime runs rampant streets man batman still tortured memories parents murders civil society crumbles around bruce waynes longsuppressed vigilante side finally breaks free selfimposed shackles dark knight returns blaze fury taking whole new generation criminals matching level violence soon joined generations robina girl named carrie kelley proves invaluable predecessorsbut batman robin deal threat posed deadliest enemies years incarceration made perfect psychopaths important anyone survive coming fallout undeclared war superpowersor clash worlds greatest superheroesover fifteen years debut batman dark knight returns remains undisputed classic one influential stories ever told comics mediumcollecting batman dark knight returns batman dark knight returnsfrank miller klaus janson illustrator lynn varley illustratorbatman dark knight returns batman dark knight returnsfrank miller klaus janson illustrator lynn varley illustratorbatman dark knight returns

Elantris,Brandon Sanderson (Goodreads Author),4.18,"Elantris was the capital of Arelon: gigantic, beautiful, literally radiant, filled with benevolent beings who used their powerful magical abilities for the benefit of all. Yet each of these demigods was once an ordinary person until touched by the mysterious transforming power of the Shaod. Ten years ago, without warning, the magic failed. Elantrians became wizened, leper-like, powerless creatures, and Elantris itself dark, filthy, and crumbling.Arelon's new capital, Kae, crouches in the shadow of Elantris. Princess Sarene of Teod arrives for a marriage of state with Crown Prince Raoden, hoping -- based on their correspondence -- to also find love. She finds instead that Raoden has died and she is considered his widow. Both Teod and Arelon are under threat as the last remaining holdouts against the imperial ambitions of the ruthless religious fanatics of Fjordell. So Sarene decides to use her new status to counter the machinations of Hrathen, a Fjordell high priest who has come to Kae to convert Arelon and claim it for his emperor and his god.But neither Sarene nor Hrathen suspect the truth about Prince Raoden. Stricken by the same curse that ruined Elantris, Raoden was secretly exiled by his father to the dark city. His struggle to help the wretches trapped there begins a series of events that will bring hope to Arelon, and perhaps reveal the secret of Elantris itself.A rare epic fantasy that doesn't recycle the classics and that is a complete and satisfying story in one volume, Elantris is fleet and fun, full of surprises and characters to care about. It's also the wonderful debut of a welcome new star in the constellation of fantasy.ElantrisBrandon Sanderson (Goodreads Author)Elantris #1ElantrisBrandon Sanderson (Goodreads Author)Elantris #1",English,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Epic Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Adult', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Magic', 'Romance', 'Science Fiction']",638,Tor Fantasy,May 30th 2006,176059,95.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1475740953l/68427._SY475_.jpg,elantris capital arelon gigantic beautiful literally radiant filled benevolent beings used powerful magical abilities benefit yet demigods ordinary person touched mysterious transforming power shaod ten years ago without warning magic failed elantrians became wizened leperlike powerless creatures elantris dark filthy crumblingarelons new capital kae crouches shadow elantris princess sarene teod arrives marriage state crown prince raoden hoping based correspondence also find love finds instead raoden died considered widow teod arelon threat last remaining holdouts imperial ambitions ruthless religious fanatics fjordell sarene decides use new status counter machinations hrathen fjordell high priest come kae convert arelon claim emperor godbut neither sarene hrathen suspect truth prince raoden stricken curse ruined elantris raoden secretly exiled father dark city struggle help wretches trapped begins series events bring hope arelon perhaps reveal secret elantris itselfa rare epic fantasy doesnt recycle classics complete satisfying story one volume elantris fleet fun full surprises characters care also wonderful debut welcome new star constellation fantasyelantrisbrandon sanderson goodreads authorelantris elantrisbrandon sanderson goodreads authorelantris
It Ends with Us,Colleen Hoover (Goodreads Author),4.4,"Sometimes it is the one who loves you who hurts you the most.Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She’s come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up — she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan — her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.It Ends with UsColleen Hoover (Goodreads Author)It Ends with UsColleen Hoover (Goodreads Author)",English,"['Romance', 'Contemporary', 'New Adult', 'Fiction', 'Contemporary Romance', 'Adult', 'Abuse', 'Chick Lit', 'Audiobook', 'Young Adult']",385,Atria Books,August 2nd 2016,211963,96.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1470427482l/27362503._SY475_.jpg,sometimes one loves hurts mostlily hasnt always easy thats never stopped working hard life wants shes come long way small town maine grew graduated college moved boston started business feels spark gorgeous neurosurgeon named ryle kincaid everything lilys life suddenly seems almost good trueryle assertive stubborn maybe even little arrogant hes also sensitive brilliant total soft spot lily way looks scrubs certainly doesnt hurt lily cant get head ryles complete aversion relationships disturbing even lily finds becoming exception dating rule cant help wonder made way first placeas questions new relationship overwhelm thoughts atlas corrigan first love link past left behind kindred spirit protector atlas suddenly reappears everything lily built ryle threatenedit ends uscolleen hoover goodreads authorit ends uscolleen hoover goodreads author

A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier,Ishmael Beah,4.16,"The devastating story of war through the eyes of a child soldier. Beah tells how, at the age of twelve, he fled attacking rebels and wandered a land rendered unrecognizable by violence. By thirteen, he’d been picked up by the government army, and became a soldier.My new friends have begun to suspect I haven’t told them the full story of my life.“Why did you leave Sierra Leone?”“Because there is a war.”“You mean, you saw people running around with guns and shooting each other?”“Yes, all the time.”“Cool.”I smile a little.“You should tell us about it sometime.”“Yes, sometime.” This is how wars are fought now: by children, hopped-up on drugs and wielding AK-47s. Children have become soldiers of choice. In the more than fifty conflicts going on worldwide, it is estimated that there are some 300,000 child soldiers. Ishmael Beah used to be one of them. What is war like through the eyes of a child soldier? How does one become a killer? How does one stop? Child soldiers have been profiled by journalists, and novelists have struggled to imagine their lives. But until now, there has not been a first-person account from someone who came through this hell and survived.In A Long Way Gone, Beah, now twenty-five years old, tells a riveting story: how at the age of twelve, he fled attacking rebels and wandered a land rendered unrecognizable by violence. By thirteen, he’d been picked up by the government army, and Beah, at heart a gentle boy, found that he was capable of truly terrible acts.

Old Man's War,John Scalzi (Goodreads Author),4.22,"John Perry did two things on his 75th birthday. First he visited his wife's grave. Then he joined the army.The good news is that humanity finally made it into interstellar space. The bad news is that planets fit to live on are scarce-- and alien races willing to fight us for them are common. So: we fight. To defend Earth, and to stake our own claim to planetary real estate. Far from Earth, the war has been going on for decades: brutal, bloody, unyielding.Earth itself is a backwater. The bulk of humanity's resources are in the hands of the Colonial Defense Force. Everybody knows that when you reach retirement age, you can join the CDF. They don't want young people; they want people who carry the knowledge and skills of decades of living. You'll be taken off Earth and never allowed to return. You'll serve two years at the front. And if you survive, you'll be given a generous homestead stake of your own, on one of our hard-won colony planets.John Perry is taking that deal. He has only the vaguest idea what to expect. Because the actual fight, light-years from home, is far, far harder than he can imagine--and what he will become is far stranger.Old Man's WarJohn Scalzi (Goodreads Author)Old Man's War #1Old Man's WarJohn Scalzi (Goodreads Author)Old Man's War #1",English,"['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Military Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'War', 'Space', 'Audiobook', 'Fantasy', 'Adventure']",332,Tor Books,April 1st 2007,161551,96.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1509467059l/36510196._SY475_.jpg,john perry two things th birthday first visited wifes grave joined armythe good news humanity finally made interstellar space bad news planets fit live scarce alien races willing fight us common fight defend earth stake claim planetary real estate far earth war going decades brutal bloody unyieldingearth backwater bulk humanitys resources hands colonial defense force everybody knows reach retirement age join cdf dont want young people want people carry knowledge skills decades living youll taken earth never allowed return youll serve two years front survive youll given generous homestead stake one hardwon colony planetsjohn perry taking deal vaguest idea expect actual fight lightyears home far far harder imagineand become far strangerold mans warjohn scalzi goodreads authorold mans war old mans warjohn scalzi goodreads authorold mans war

Where the Crawdads Sing,Delia Owens (Goodreads Author),4.47,"For years, rumors of the “Marsh Girl” have haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say. Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life–until the unthinkable happens.Perfect for fans of Barbara Kingsolver and Karen Russell, Where the Crawdads Sing is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible murder.

The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment,Eckhart Tolle,4.13,"Eckhart Tolle's message is simple: living in the now is the truest path to happiness and enlightenment. And while this message may not seem stunningly original or fresh, Tolle's clear writing, supportive voice and enthusiasm make this an excellent manual for anyone who's ever wondered what exactly ""living in the now"" means. Foremost, Tolle is a world-class teacher, able to explain complicated concepts in concrete language. More importantly, within a chapter of reading this book, readers are already holding the world in a different container--more conscious of how thoughts and emotions get in the way of their ability to live in genuine peace and happiness.Tolle packs a lot of information and inspirational ideas into The Power of Now. (Topics include the source of Chi, enlightened relationships, creative use of the mind, impermanence and the cycle of life.) Thankfully, he's added markers that symbolise ""break time"". This is when readers should close the book and mull over what they just read. As a result, The Power of Now reads like the highly acclaimed A Course in Miracles--a spiritual guidebook that has the potential to inspire just as many study groups and change just as many lives for the better. --Gail HudsonThe Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual EnlightenmentEckhart TolleThe Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual EnlightenmentEckhart Tolle",English,"['Self Help', 'Nonfiction', 'Spirituality', 'Philosophy', 'Psychology', 'Personal Development', 'Audiobook', 'Religion', 'Inspirational', 'Unfinished']",229,New World Library,August 19th 2004,210620,91.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386925535l/6708.jpg,eckhart tolles message simple living truest path happiness enlightenment message may seem stunningly original fresh tolles clear writing supportive voice enthusiasm make excellent manual anyone whos ever wondered exactly living means foremost tolle worldclass teacher able explain complicated concepts concrete language importantly within chapter reading book readers already holding world different containermore conscious thoughts emotions get way ability live genuine peace happinesstolle packs lot information inspirational ideas power topics include source chi enlightened relationships creative use mind impermanence cycle life thankfully hes added markers symbolise break time readers close book mull read result power reads like highly acclaimed course miraclesa spiritual guidebook potential inspire many study groups change many lives better gail hudsonthe power guide spiritual enlightenmenteckhart tollethe power guide spiritual enlightenmenteckhart tolle
Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking,Susan Cain (Goodreads Author),4.06,"The book that started the Quiet RevolutionAt least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introverts—Rosa Parks, Chopin, Dr. Seuss, Steve Wozniak—that we owe many of the great contributions to society. In Quiet, Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts—from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Passionately argued, superbly researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, Quiet has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how they see themselves.Now with Extra Libris material, including a reader’s guide and bonus content.Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop TalkingSusan Cain (Goodreads Author)QuietQuiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop TalkingSusan Cain (Goodreads Author)Quiet",English,"['Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Self Help', 'Science', 'Business', 'Audiobook', 'Personal Development', 'Sociology', 'Leadership', 'Adult']",333,"Crown Publishing Group/Random House, Inc.",January 24th 2012,323829,93.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328562861l/8520610.jpg,book started quiet revolutionat least onethird people know introverts ones prefer listening speaking innovate create dislike selfpromotion favor working working teams introvertsrosa parks chopin dr seuss steve wozniakthat owe many great contributions society quiet susan cain argues dramatically undervalue introverts shows much lose charts rise extrovert ideal throughout twentieth century explores deeply come permeate culture also introduces us successful introvertsfrom witty highoctane public speaker recharges solitude talks recordbreaking salesman quietly taps power questions passionately argued superbly researched filled indelible stories real people quiet power permanently change see introverts equally important see themselvesnow extra libris material including readers guide bonus contentquiet power introverts world cant stop talkingsusan cain goodreads authorquietquiet power introverts world cant stop talkingsusan cain goodreads authorquiet
Heaven is for Real: A Little Boy's Astounding Story of His Trip to Heaven and Back,"Todd Burpo, Lynn Vincent (Goodreads Author)",4.02,"When Colton Burpo made it through an emergency appendectomy, his family was overjoyed at his miraculous survival. What they weren't expecting, though, was the story that emerged in the months that followed--a story as beautiful as it was extraordinary, detailing their little boy's trip to heaven and back.Colton, not yet four years old, told his parents he left his body during the surgery--and authenticated that claim by describing exactly what his parents were doing in another part of the hospital while he was being operated on. He talked of visiting heaven and relayed stories told to him by people he met there whom he had never met in life, sharing events that happened even before he was born. He also astonished his parents with descriptions and obscure details about heaven that matched the Bible exactly, though he had not yet learned to read.With disarming innocence and the plainspoken boldness of a child, Colton tells of meeting long-departed family members. He describes Jesus, the angels, how ""really, really big"" God is, and how much God loves us. Retold by his father, but using Colton's uniquely simple words, ""Heaven is for Real"" offers a glimpse of the world that awaits us, where as Colton says, ""Nobody is old and nobody wears glasses.""""Heaven is for Real"" will forever change the way you think of eternity, offering you the chance to see, and believe, like a child.Heaven is for Real: A Little Boy's Astounding Story of His Trip to Heaven and BackTodd Burpo, Lynn Vincent (Goodreads Author)Heaven is For RealHeaven is for Real: A Little Boy's Astounding Story of His Trip to Heaven and BackTodd Burpo, Lynn Vincent (Goodreads Author)Heaven is For Real",English,"['Nonfiction', 'Christian', 'Religion', 'Inspirational', 'Spirituality', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Faith', 'Christianity', 'Christian Non Fiction']",162,Thomas Nelson,2010,276970,90.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348467278l/7933292.jpg,colton burpo made emergency appendectomy family overjoyed miraculous survival werent expecting though story emerged months followeda story beautiful extraordinary detailing little boys trip heaven backcolton yet four years old told parents left body surgeryand authenticated claim describing exactly parents another part hospital operated talked visiting heaven relayed stories told people met never met life sharing events happened even born also astonished parents descriptions obscure details heaven matched bible exactly though yet learned readwith disarming innocence plainspoken boldness child colton tells meeting longdeparted family members describes jesus angels really really big god much god loves us retold father using coltons uniquely simple words heaven real offers glimpse world awaits us colton says nobody old nobody wears glassesheaven real forever change way think eternity offering chance see believe like childheaven real little boys astounding story trip heaven backtodd burpo lynn vincent goodreads authorheaven realheaven real little boys astounding story trip heaven backtodd burpo lynn vincent goodreads authorheaven real

She works through the night, preparing the day’s breads and pastries, trying to escape a reality of loneliness, bad memories, and the shadow of her mother’s death. When Josef Weber, an elderly man in Sage’s grief support group, begins stopping by the bakery, they strike up an unlikely friendship. Despite their differences, they see in each other the hidden scars that others can’t, and they become companions.Everything changes on the day that Josef confesses a long-buried and shameful secret—one that nobody else in town would ever suspect—and asks Sage for an extraordinary favor.

Wallbanger,Alice Clayton (Goodreads Author),4.05,"The first night after Caroline moves into her fantastic new San Francisco apartment, she realizes she's gaining an intimate knowledge of her new neighbor's nocturnal adventures. Thanks to paper-thin walls and the guy's athletic prowess, she can hear not just his bed banging against the wall but the ecstatic response of what seems (as loud night after loud night goes by) like an endless parade of women. And since Caroline is currently on a self-imposed dating hiatus, and her neighbor is clearly lethally attractive to women, she finds her fantasies keep her awake even longer than the noise. So when the wallbanging threatens to literally bounce her out of bed, Caroline, clad in sexual frustration and a pink baby-doll nightie, confronts Simon Parker, her heard-but-never-seen neighbor. The tension between them is as thick as the walls are thin, and the results just as mixed.

Educated,Tara Westover (Goodreads Author),4.47,"Tara Westover was 17 the first time she set foot in a classroom. Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her ""head-for-the-hills bag"". In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother, a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged in her father's junkyard.Her father forbade hospitals, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent.Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home.Educated is an account of the struggle for self-invention.

Firefly Lane,Kristin Hannah (Goodreads Author),4.08,"From the New York Times bestselling author of On Mystic Lake comes a powerful novel of love, loss, and the magic of friendship. . . .In the turbulent summer of 1974, Kate Mularkey has accepted her place at the bottom of the eighth-grade social food chain. Then, to her amazement, the “coolest girl in the world” moves in across the street and wants to be her friend. Tully Hart seems to have it all---beauty, brains, ambition. On the surface they are as opposite as two people can be: Kate, doomed to be forever uncool, with a loving family who mortifies her at every turn. Tully, steeped in glamour and mystery, but with a secret that is destroying her. They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summer’s end they’ve become TullyandKate. Inseparable.So begins Kristin Hannah’s magnificent new novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, Firefly Lane is the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the bulkhead of their lives.From the beginning, Tully is desperate to prove her worth to the world. Abandoned by her mother at an early age, she longs to be loved unconditionally. In the glittering, big-hair era of the eighties, she looks to men to fill the void in her soul. But in the buttoned-down nineties, it is television news that captivates her. She will follow her own blind ambition to New York and around the globe, finding fame and success . . . and loneliness. Kate knows early on that her life will be nothing special. Throughout college, she pretends to be driven by a need for success, but all she really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesn’t know is how being a wife and mother will change her . . . how she’ll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much she’ll envy her famous best friend. . . .For thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship---jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think they’ve survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart . . . and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test.Firefly Lane is for anyone who ever drank Boone’s Farm apple wine while listening to Abba or Fleetwood Mac. More than a coming-of-age novel, it’s the story of a generation of women who were both blessed and cursed by choices. It’s about promises and secrets and betrayals. And ultimately, about the one person who really, truly knows you---and knows what has the power to hurt you . . . and heal you. Firefly Lane is a story you’ll never forget . . . one you’ll want to pass on to your best friend.Firefly LaneKristin Hannah (Goodreads Author)Firefly Lane #1Firefly LaneKristin Hannah (Goodreads Author)Firefly Lane #1",English,"['Fiction', 'Chick Lit', 'Romance', 'Contemporary', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Drama', 'Womens Fiction', 'Book Club']",479,St. Martin's Press,February 5th 2008,199333,94.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1362435448l/1472878.jpg,new york times bestselling author mystic lake comes powerful novel love loss magic friendship turbulent summer kate mularkey accepted place bottom eighthgrade social food chain amazement coolest girl world moves across street wants friend tully hart seems allbeauty brains ambition surface opposite two people kate doomed forever uncool loving family mortifies every turn tully steeped glamour mystery secret destroying make pact best friends forever summers end theyve become tullyandkate inseparableso begins kristin hannahs magnificent new novel spanning three decades playing across everchanging face pacific northwest firefly lane poignant powerful story two women friendship becomes bulkhead livesfrom beginning tully desperate prove worth world abandoned mother early age longs loved unconditionally glittering bighair era eighties looks men fill void soul buttoneddown nineties television news captivates follow blind ambition new york around globe finding fame success loneliness kate knows early life nothing special throughout college pretends driven need success really wants fall love children live ordinary life quiet way kate driven tully doesnt know wife mother change shell lose sight wanted much shell envy famous best friend thirty years tully kate buoy life weathering storms friendshipjealousy anger hurt resentment think theyve survived single act betrayal tears apart puts courage friendship ultimate testfirefly lane anyone ever drank boones farm apple wine listening abba fleetwood mac comingofage novel story generation women blessed cursed choices promises secrets betrayals ultimately one person really truly knows youand knows power hurt heal firefly lane story youll never forget one youll want pass best friendfirefly lanekristin hannah goodreads authorfirefly lane firefly lanekristin hannah goodreads authorfirefly lane

But Circe is a strange child—not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power—the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves.Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus.But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians.

Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood,"Marjane Satrapi, Mattias Ripa (Translator)",4.25,"A New York Times Notable BookA Time Magazine “Best Comix of the Year”A San Francisco Chronicle and Los Angeles Times Best-sellerWise, funny, and heartbreaking, Persepolis is Marjane Satrapi’s memoir of growing up in Iran during the Islamic Revolution. In powerful black-and-white comic strip images, Satrapi tells the story of her life in Tehran from ages six to fourteen, years that saw the overthrow of the Shah’s regime, the triumph of the Islamic Revolution, and the devastating effects of war with Iraq. The intelligent and outspoken only child of committed Marxists and the great-granddaughter of one of Iran’s last emperors, Marjane bears witness to a childhood uniquely entwined with the history of her country.Persepolis paints an unforgettable portrait of daily life in Iran and of the bewildering contradictions between home life and public life.

Intensely personal, profoundly political, and wholly original, Persepolis is at once a story of growing up and a reminder of the human cost of war and political repression.

Steve Jobs,Walter Isaacson (Goodreads Author),4.14,"Walter Isaacson's ""enthralling"" (The New Yorker) worldwide bestselling biography of Apple cofounder Steve Jobs. Based on more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs conducted over two years--as well as interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues--Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. Isaacson's portrait touched millions of readers. At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with the author, he asked for no control over what was written. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. He himself spoke candidly about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues offer an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values. Steve Jobs is the inspiration for the movie of the same name starring Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, and Jeff Daniels, directed by Danny Boyle with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin.Steve JobsWalter Isaacson (Goodreads Author)Steve JobsWalter Isaacson (Goodreads Author)",English,"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Technology', 'History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Leadership', 'Memoir', 'Autobiography']",627,Simon & Schuster,October 24th 2011,956505,93.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1511288482l/11084145._SY475_.jpg,walter isaacsons enthralling new yorker worldwide bestselling biography apple cofounder steve jobs based forty interviews steve jobs conducted two yearsas well interviews family members friends adversaries competitors colleagueswalter isaacson written riveting story rollercoaster life searingly intense personality creative entrepreneur whose passion perfection ferocious drive revolutionized six industries personal computers animated movies music phones tablet computing digital publishing isaacsons portrait touched millions readers time america seeking ways sustain innovative edge jobs stands ultimate icon inventiveness applied imagination knew best way create value twentyfirst century connect creativity technology built company leaps imagination combined remarkable feats engineering although jobs cooperated author asked control written put nothing offlimits encouraged people knew speak honestly spoke candidly people worked competed friends foes colleagues offer unvarnished view passions perfectionism obsessions artistry devilry compulsion control shaped approach business innovative products resulted tale instructive cautionary filled lessons innovation character leadership values steve jobs inspiration movie name starring michael fassbender kate winslet seth rogen jeff daniels directed danny boyle screenplay aaron sorkinsteve jobswalter isaacson goodreads authorsteve jobswalter isaacson goodreads author

When Breath Becomes Air,Paul Kalanithi,4.36,"For readers of Atul Gawande, Andrew Solomon, and Anne Lamott, a profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir by a young neurosurgeon faced with a terminal cancer diagnosis who attempts to answer the question 'What makes a life worth living?'At the age of thirty-six, on the verge of completing a decade's worth of training as a neurosurgeon, Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi's transformation from a naïve medical student ""possessed,"" as he wrote, ""by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life"" into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality. What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir. Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. ""I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything,"" he wrote. ""Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: 'I can't go on. I'll go on.'"" When Breath Becomes Air is an unforgettable, life-affirming reflection on the challenge of facing death and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a brilliant writer who became both.When Breath Becomes AirPaul KalanithiWhen Breath Becomes AirPaul Kalanithi",English,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Medicine', 'Medical', 'Audiobook', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Philosophy', 'Science']",208,Random House,January 19th 2016,415362,96.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1492677644l/25899336.jpg,readers atul gawande andrew solomon anne lamott profoundly moving exquisitely observed memoir young neurosurgeon faced terminal cancer diagnosis attempts answer question makes life worth livingat age thirtysix verge completing decades worth training neurosurgeon paul kalanithi diagnosed stage iv lung cancer one day doctor treating dying next patient struggling live like future wife imagined evaporated breath becomes air chronicles kalanithis transformation nave medical student possessed wrote question given organisms die makes virtuous meaningful life neurosurgeon stanford working brain critical place human identity finally patient new father confronting mortality makes life worth living face death future longer ladder toward goals life flattens perpetual present mean child nurture new life another fades away questions kalanithi wrestles profoundly moving exquisitely observed memoir paul kalanithi died march working book yet words live guide gift us began realize coming face face mortality sense changed nothing everything wrote seven words samuel beckett began repeat head cant go ill go breath becomes air unforgettable lifeaffirming reflection challenge facing death relationship doctor patient brilliant writer became bothwhen breath becomes airpaul kalanithiwhen breath becomes airpaul kalanithi

Readers and critics were enchanted; as NPR commented, “Towles writes with grace and verve about the mores and manners of a society on the cusp of radical change.”A Gentleman in Moscow immerses us in another elegantly drawn era with the story of Count Alexander Rostov. When, in 1922, he is deemed an unrepentant aristocrat by a Bolshevik tribunal, the count is sentenced to house arrest in the Metropol, a grand hotel across the street from the Kremlin.

Unexpectedly, his reduced circumstances provide him a doorway into a much larger world of emotional discovery.Brimming with humour, a glittering cast of characters, and one beautifully rendered scene after another, this singular novel casts a spell as it relates the count’s endeavour to gain a deeper understanding of what it means to be a man of purpose.A Gentleman in MoscowAmor Towles (Goodreads Author)A Gentleman in MoscowAmor Towles (Goodreads Author)",English,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Russia', 'Historical', 'Audiobook', 'Book Club', 'Literary Fiction', 'Novels', 'Adult Fiction', 'Adult']",462,Penguin Books,March 26th 2019,293330,96.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1551480896l/34066798._SY475_.jpg,new york times bestselling author rules civilitya transporting novel man ordered spend rest life inside luxury hotelwith breakout debut novel rules civility amor towles established master absorbing sophisticated fiction bringing late manhattan life splendid atmosphere flawless command style readers critics enchanted npr commented towles writes grace verve mores manners society cusp radical changea gentleman moscow immerses us another elegantly drawn era story count alexander rostov deemed unrepentant aristocrat bolshevik tribunal count sentenced house arrest metropol grand hotel across street kremlin rostov indomitable man erudition wit never worked day life must live attic room tumultuous decades russian history unfolding outside hotels doors unexpectedly reduced circumstances provide doorway much larger world emotional discoverybrimming humour glittering cast characters one beautifully rendered scene another singular novel casts spell relates counts endeavour gain deeper understanding means man purposea gentleman moscowamor towles goodreads authora gentleman moscowamor towles goodreads author

"Thinking, Fast and Slow",Daniel Kahneman,4.16,"In the highly anticipated Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. The impact of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the challenges of properly framing risks at work and at home, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning the next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions.Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. Thinking, Fast and Slow will transform the way you think about thinking.Thinking, Fast and SlowDaniel KahnemanThinking, Fast and SlowDaniel Kahneman",English,"['Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Science', 'Business', 'Economics', 'Self Help', 'Personal Development', 'Philosophy', 'Audiobook', 'Unfinished']",499,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux",October 25th 2011,309325,94.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1317793965l/11468377.jpg,highly anticipated thinking fast slow kahneman takes us groundbreaking tour mind explains two systems drive way think system fast intuitive emotional system slower deliberative logical kahneman exposes extraordinary capabilitiesand also faults biasesof fast thinking reveals pervasive influence intuitive impressions thoughts behavior impact loss aversion overconfidence corporate strategies difficulties predicting make us happy future challenges properly framing risks work home profound effect cognitive biases everything playing stock market planning next vacationeach understood knowing two systems work together shape judgments decisionsengaging reader lively conversation think kahneman reveals trust intuitions tap benefits slow thinking offers practical enlightening insights choices made business personal livesand use different techniques guard mental glitches often get us trouble thinking fast slow transform way think thinkingthinking fast slowdaniel kahnemanthinking fast slowdaniel kahneman
1776,David McCullough,4.07,"In this masterful book, David McCullough tells the intensely human story of those who marched with General George Washington in the year of the Declaration of Independence - when the whole American cause was riding on their success, without which all hope for independence would have been dashed and the noble ideals of the Declaration would have amounted to little more than words on paper.Based on extensive research in both American and British archives, 1776 is a powerful drama written with extraordinary narrative vitality. It is the story of Americans in the ranks, men of every shape, size, and color, farmers, schoolteachers, shoemakers, no-accounts, and mere boys turned soldiers. And it is the story of the King's men, the British commander, William Howe, an his highly disciplined redcoats who looked on their rebel foes with contempt and fought with a valor too little known.At the center of the drama, with Washington, are two young American patriots, who, at first, knew no more of war than what they had read in books - Nathaniel Green, a Quaker who was made a general at thirty-three, and Henry Knox, a twenty-five-year-old bookseller who had the preposterous idea of hauling the guns of Fort Ticonderoga overland to Boston in the dead of Winter.But it is the American commander-in-chief who stands foremost - Washington, who had never before led an army in battle. Written as a companion work to his celebrated biography of John Adams, David McCullough's 1776 is another landmark in the literature of American history.1776David McCullough1776David McCullough",English,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'American History', 'Historical', 'American Revolution', 'War', 'Audiobook', 'American Revolutionary War', 'Military Fiction', 'Politics']",386,Simon Schuster,July 4th 2006,186362,93.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1306787560l/1067.jpg,masterful book david mccullough tells intensely human story marched general george washington year declaration independence whole american cause riding success without hope independence would dashed noble ideals declaration would amounted little words paperbased extensive research american british archives powerful drama written extraordinary narrative vitality story americans ranks men every shape size color farmers schoolteachers shoemakers noaccounts mere boys turned soldiers story kings men british commander william howe highly disciplined redcoats looked rebel foes contempt fought valor little knownat center drama washington two young american patriots first knew war read books nathaniel green quaker made general thirtythree henry knox twentyfiveyearold bookseller preposterous idea hauling guns fort ticonderoga overland boston dead winterbut american commanderinchief stands foremost washington never led army battle written companion work celebrated biography john adams david mcculloughs another landmark literature american historydavid mcculloughdavid mccullough

"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies",Jared Diamond,4.03,"""Diamond has written a book of remarkable scope ... one of the most important and readable works on the human past published in recent years.""Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and a national bestseller: the global account of the rise of civilization that is also a stunning refutation of ideas of human development based on race.In this ""artful, informative, and delightful"" (William H. McNeill, New York Review of Books) book, Jared Diamond convincingly argues that geographical and environmental factors shaped the modern world. Societies that had a head start in food production advanced beyond the hunter-gatherer stage, and then developed writing, technology, government, and organized religion—as well as nasty germs and potent weapons of war—and adventured on sea and land to conquer and decimate preliterate cultures. A major advance in our understanding of human societies, Guns, Germs, and Steel chronicles the way that the modern world came to be and stunningly dismantles racially based theories of human history.Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, the Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science, the Rhone-Poulenc Prize, and the Commonwealth Club of California's Gold MedalGuns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human SocietiesJared DiamondCivilizations Rise and Fall #1Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human SocietiesJared DiamondCivilizations Rise and Fall #1",English,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Anthropology', 'Sociology', 'Politics', 'Economics', 'Historical', 'World History', 'Geography']",425,W.W.

Between the World and Me,Ta-Nehisi Coates,4.39,"“This is your country, this is your world, this is your body, and you must find some way to live within the all of it.” In a profound work that pivots from the biggest questions about American history and ideals to the most intimate concerns of a father for his son, Ta-Nehisi Coates offers a powerful new framework for understanding our nation’s history and current crisis. Americans have built an empire on the idea of “race,” a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men—bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden?  Between the World and Me is Ta-Nehisi Coates’s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son—and readers—the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children’s lives were taken as American plunder. Beautifully woven from personal narrative, reimagined history, and fresh, emotionally charged reportage, Between the World and Me clearly illuminates the past, bracingly confronts our present, and offers a transcendent vision for a way forward.Between the World and MeTa-Nehisi CoatesBetween the World and MeTa-Nehisi Coates",English,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Race', 'Audiobook', 'History', 'Biography', 'Social Justice', 'Essays', 'Politics', 'African American']",152,Spiegel & Grau,July 14th 2015,235339,96.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1451435027l/25489625._SY475_.jpg,country world body must find way live within profound work pivots biggest questions american history ideals intimate concerns father son tanehisi coates offers powerful new framework understanding nations history current crisis americans built empire idea race falsehood damages us falls heavily bodies black women menbodies exploited slavery segregation today threatened locked murdered proportion like inhabit black body find way live within honestly reckon fraught history free burden world tanehisi coatess attempt answer questions letter adolescent son coates shares sonand readersthe story awakening truth place world series revelatory experiences howard university civil war battlefields south side chicago paris childhood home living rooms mothers whose childrens lives taken american plunder beautifully woven personal narrative reimagined history fresh emotionally charged reportage world clearly illuminates past bracingly confronts present offers transcendent vision way forwardbetween world metanehisi coatesbetween world metanehisi coates
Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,Doris Kearns Goodwin,4.28,"Winner of the Lincoln PrizeAcclaimed historian Doris Kearns Goodwin illuminates Lincoln's political genius in this highly original work, as the one-term congressman and prairie lawyer rises from obscurity to prevail over three gifted rivals of national reputation to become president.On May 18, 1860, William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, Edward Bates, and Abraham Lincoln waited in their hometowns for the results from the Republican National Convention in Chicago. When Lincoln emerged as the victor, his rivals were dismayed and angry.Throughout the turbulent 1850s, each had energetically sought the presidency as the conflict over slavery was leading inexorably to secession and civil war. That Lincoln succeeded, Goodwin demonstrates, was the result of a character that had been forged by experiences that raised him above his more privileged and accomplished rivals. He won because he possessed an extraordinary ability to put himself in the place of other men, to experience what they were feeling, to understand their motives and desires.It was this capacity that enabled Lincoln as president to bring his disgruntled opponents together, create the most unusual cabinet in history, and marshal their talents to the task of preserving the Union and winning the war.We view the long, horrifying struggle from the vantage of the White House as Lincoln copes with incompetent generals, hostile congressmen, and his raucous cabinet. He overcomes these obstacles by winning the respect of his former competitors, and in the case of Seward, finds a loyal and crucial friend to see him through.This brilliant multiple biography is centered on Lincoln's mastery of men and how it shaped the most significant presidency in the nation's history.Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham LincolnDoris Kearns GoodwinTeam of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham LincolnDoris Kearns Goodwin",English,"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Politics', 'American History', 'Civil War', 'Presidents', 'Leadership', 'Historical', 'Audiobook']",916,Simon & Schuster,September 26th 2006,151931,93.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347278868l/2199.jpg,winner lincoln prizeacclaimed historian doris kearns goodwin illuminates lincolns political genius highly original work oneterm congressman prairie lawyer rises obscurity prevail three gifted rivals national reputation become presidenton may william h seward salmon p chase edward bates abraham lincoln waited hometowns results republican national convention chicago lincoln emerged victor rivals dismayed angrythroughout turbulent energetically sought presidency conflict slavery leading inexorably secession civil war lincoln succeeded goodwin demonstrates result character forged experiences raised privileged accomplished rivals possessed extraordinary ability put place men experience feeling understand motives desiresit capacity enabled lincoln president bring disgruntled opponents together create unusual cabinet history marshal talents task preserving union winning warwe view long horrifying struggle vantage white house lincoln copes incompetent generals hostile congressmen raucous cabinet overcomes obstacles winning respect former competitors case seward finds loyal crucial friend see throughthis brilliant multiple biography centered lincolns mastery men shaped significant presidency nations historyteam rivals political genius abraham lincolndoris kearns goodwinteam rivals political genius abraham lincolndoris kearns goodwin

Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood,Trevor Noah,4.45,"The memoir of one man’s coming-of-age, set during the twilight of apartheid and the tumultuous days of freedom that followed. Trevor Noah’s unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of The Daily Show began with a criminal act: his birth. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents’ indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa’s tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle. Born a Crime is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man’s relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother—his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life.Born a Crime: Stories From a South African ChildhoodTrevor NoahBorn a Crime: Stories From a South African ChildhoodTrevor Noah",English,"['Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Biography', 'Audiobook', 'Humor', 'Autobiography', 'Africa', 'Biography Memoir', 'Race', 'South Africa']",289,Doubleday Canada,November 15th 2016,389493,96.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1473867911l/29780253.jpg,memoir one mans comingofage set twilight apartheid tumultuous days freedom followed trevor noahs unlikely path apartheid south africa desk daily show began criminal act birth trevor born white swiss father black xhosa mother time union punishable five years prison living proof parents indiscretion trevor kept mostly indoors earliest years life bound extreme often absurd measures mother took hide government could moment steal away finally liberated end south africas tyrannical white rule trevor mother set forth grand adventure living openly freely embracing opportunities centurieslong struggle born crime story mischievous young boy grows restless young man struggles find world never supposed exist also story young mans relationship fearless rebellious fervently religious motherhis teammate woman determined save son cycle poverty violence abuse would ultimately threaten lifeborn crime stories south african childhoodtrevor noahborn crime stories south african childhoodtrevor noah

"Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen",Christopher McDougall,4.29,"Full of incredible characters, amazing athletic achievements, cutting-edge science, and, most of all, pure inspiration, Born to Run is an epic adventure that began with one simple question: Why does my foot hurt? In search of an answer, Christopher McDougall sets off to find a tribe of the world’s greatest distance runners and learn their secrets, and in the process shows us that everything we thought we knew about running is wrong.Isolated by the most savage terrain in North America, the reclusive Tarahumara Indians of Mexico’s deadly Copper Canyons are custodians of a lost art. For centuries they have practiced techniques that allow them to run hundreds of miles without rest and chase down anything from a deer to an Olympic marathoner while enjoying every mile of it. Their superhuman talent is matched by uncanny health and serenity, leaving the Tarahumara immune to the diseases and strife that plague modern existence. With the help of Caballo Blanco, a mysterious loner who lives among the tribe, the author was able not only to uncover the secrets of the Tarahumara but also to find his own inner ultra-athlete, as he trained for the challenge of a lifetime: a fifty-mile race through the heart of Tarahumara country pitting the tribe against an odd band of Americans, including a star ultramarathoner, a beautiful young surfer, and a barefoot wonder.With a sharp wit and wild exuberance, McDougall takes us from the high-tech science labs at Harvard to the sun-baked valleys and freezing peaks across North America, where ever-growing numbers of ultrarunners are pushing their bodies to the limit, and, finally, to the climactic race in the Copper Canyons. Born to Run is that rare book that will not only engage your mind but inspire your body when you realize that the secret to happiness is right at your feet, and that you, indeed all of us, were born to run.Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never SeenChristopher McDougallBorn to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never SeenChristopher McDougall",English,"['Nonfiction', 'Sports', 'Health', 'Fitness', 'Adventure', 'Science', 'Memoir', 'Audiobook', 'Travel', 'Biography']",287,Knopf,May 5th 2009,168304,96.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320531983l/6289283.jpg,full incredible characters amazing athletic achievements cuttingedge science pure inspiration born run epic adventure began one simple question foot hurt search answer christopher mcdougall sets find tribe worlds greatest distance runners learn secrets process shows us everything thought knew running wrongisolated savage terrain north america reclusive tarahumara indians mexicos deadly copper canyons custodians lost art centuries practiced techniques allow run hundreds miles without rest chase anything deer olympic marathoner enjoying every mile superhuman talent matched uncanny health serenity leaving tarahumara immune diseases strife plague modern existence help caballo blanco mysterious loner lives among tribe author able uncover secrets tarahumara also find inner ultraathlete trained challenge lifetime fiftymile race heart tarahumara country pitting tribe odd band americans including star ultramarathoner beautiful young surfer barefoot wonderwith sharp wit wild exuberance mcdougall takes us hightech science labs harvard sunbaked valleys freezing peaks across north america evergrowing numbers ultrarunners pushing bodies limit finally climactic race copper canyons born run rare book engage mind inspire body realize secret happiness right feet indeed us born runborn run hidden tribe superathletes greatest race world never seenchristopher mcdougallborn run hidden tribe superathletes greatest race world never seenchristopher mcdougall

Pachinko,Min Jin Lee,4.26,"In the early 1900s, teenaged Sunja, the adored daughter of a crippled fisherman, falls for a wealthy stranger at the seashore near her home in Korea. He promises her the world, but when she discovers she is pregnant--and that her lover is married--she refuses to be bought.

The Grimke’s daughter, Sarah, has known from an early age she is meant to do something large in the world, but she is hemmed in by the limits imposed on women.Kidd’s sweeping novel is set in motion on Sarah’s eleventh birthday, when she is given ownership of ten year old Handful, who is to be her handmaid. We follow their remarkable journeys over the next thirty five years, as both strive for a life of their own, dramatically shaping each other’s destinies and forming a complex relationship marked by guilt, defiance, estrangement and the uneasy ways of love.As the stories build to a riveting climax, Handful will endure loss and sorrow, finding courage and a sense of self in the process. Sarah will experience crushed hopes, betrayal, unrequited love, and ostracism before leaving Charleston to find her place alongside her fearless younger sister, Angelina, as one of the early pioneers in the abolition and women’s rights movements.Inspired by the historical figure of Sarah Grimke, Kidd goes beyond the record to flesh out the rich interior lives of all of her characters, both real and invented, including Handful’s cunning mother, Charlotte, who courts danger in her search for something better.This exquisitely written novel is a triumph of storytelling that looks with unswerving eyes at a devastating wound in American history, through women whose struggles for liberation, empowerment, and expression will leave no reader unmoved.The Invention of WingsSue Monk Kidd (Goodreads Author)The Invention of WingsSue Monk Kidd (Goodreads Author)",English,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Book Club', 'Audiobook', 'Adult Fiction', 'Adult', 'Novels', 'African American', 'Southern']",384,Viking,January 7th 2014,263623,97.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386699861l/18079776.jpg,writing height narrative imaginative gifts sue monk kidd presents masterpiece hope daring quest freedom desire voice worldand newest oprahs book club selectionhetty handful grimke urban slave early nineteenth century charleston yearns life beyond suffocating walls enclose within wealthy grimke household grimkes daughter sarah known early age meant something large world hemmed limits imposed womenkidds sweeping novel set motion sarahs eleventh birthday given ownership ten year old handful handmaid follow remarkable journeys next thirty five years strive life dramatically shaping others destinies forming complex relationship marked guilt defiance estrangement uneasy ways loveas stories build riveting climax handful endure loss sorrow finding courage sense self process sarah experience crushed hopes betrayal unrequited love ostracism leaving charleston find place alongside fearless younger sister angelina one early pioneers abolition womens rights movementsinspired historical figure sarah grimke kidd goes beyond record flesh rich interior lives characters real invented including handfuls cunning mother charlotte courts danger search something betterthis exquisitely written novel triumph storytelling looks unswerving eyes devastating wound american history women whose struggles liberation empowerment expression leave reader unmovedthe invention wingssue monk kidd goodreads authorthe invention wingssue monk kidd goodreads author
The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business,Charles Duhigg (Goodreads Author),4.1,"A young woman walks into a laboratory. Over the past two years, she has transformed almost every aspect of her life. She has quit smoking, run a marathon, and been promoted at work. The patterns inside her brain, neurologists discover, have fundamentally changed.Marketers at Procter & Gamble study videos of people making their beds. They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze, on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly, one of them detects a nearly imperceptible pattern—and with a slight shift in advertising, Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year.An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employees—how they approach worker safety—and soon the firm, Alcoa, becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones.What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives. They succeeded by transforming habits.In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation. Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter & Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warren’s Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nation’s largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death.At its core, The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work. Habits aren’t destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives.The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and BusinessCharles Duhigg (Goodreads Author)The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and BusinessCharles Duhigg (Goodreads Author)",English,"['Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Self Help', 'Business', 'Personal Development', 'Productivity', 'Science', 'Audiobook', 'Leadership', 'Sociology']",375,Random House,February 28th 2012,343452,95.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1545854312l/12609433._SY475_.jpg,young woman walks laboratory past two years transformed almost every aspect life quit smoking run marathon promoted work patterns inside brain neurologists discover fundamentally changedmarketers procter gamble study videos people making beds desperately trying figure sell new product called febreze track one biggest flops company history suddenly one detects nearly imperceptible patternand slight shift advertising febreze goes earn billion dollars yearan untested ceo takes one largest companies america first order business attacking single pattern among employeeshow approach worker safetyand soon firm alcoa becomes top performer dow joneswhat people common achieved success focusing patterns shape every aspect lives succeeded transforming habitsin power habit awardwinning new york times business reporter charles duhigg takes us thrilling edge scientific discoveries explain habits exist changed penetrating intelligence ability distill vast amounts information engrossing narratives duhigg brings life whole new understanding human nature potential transformation along way learn people companies struggle change despite years trying others seem remake overnight visit laboratories neuroscientists explore habits work exactly reside brains discover right habits crucial success olympic swimmer michael phelps starbucks ceo howard schultz civilrights hero martin luther king jr go inside procter gamble target superstores rick warrens saddleback church nfl locker rooms nations largest hospitals see implementing socalled keystone habits earn billions mean difference failure success life deathat core power habit contains exhilarating argument key exercising regularly losing weight raising exceptional children becoming productive building revolutionary companies social movements achieving success understanding habits work habits arent destiny charles duhigg shows harnessing new science transform businesses communities livesthe power habit life businesscharles duhigg goodreads authorthe power habit life businesscharles duhigg goodreads author

The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics,Daniel James Brown (Goodreads Author),4.35,"For readers of Laura Hillenbrand's Seabiscuit and Unbroken, the dramatic story of the American rowing team that stunned the world at Hitler's 1936 Berlin Olympics.Daniel James Brown's robust book tells the story of the University of Washington's 1936 eight-oar crew and their epic quest for an Olympic gold medal, a team that transformed the sport and grabbed the attention of millions of Americans. The sons of loggers, shipyard workers, and farmers, the boys defeated elite rivals first from eastern and British universities and finally the German crew rowing for Adolf Hitler in the Olympic games in Berlin, 1936.The emotional heart of the story lies with one rower, Joe Rantz, a teenager without family or prospects, who rows not for glory, but to regain his shattered self-regard and to find a place he can call home. The crew is assembled by an enigmatic coach and mentored by a visionary, eccentric British boat builder, but it is their trust in each other that makes them a victorious team. They remind the country of what can be done when everyone quite literally pulls together—a perfect melding of commitment, determination, and optimism.Drawing on the boys' own diaries and journals, their photos and memories of a once-in-a-lifetime shared dream, The Boys in the Boat is an irresistible story about beating the odds and finding hope in the most desperate of times—the improbable, intimate story of nine working-class boys from the American west who, in the depths of the Great Depression, showed the world what true grit really meant. It will appeal to readers of Erik Larson, Timothy Egan, James Bradley, and David Halberstam's The Amateurs.The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold at the 1936 Berlin OlympicsDaniel James Brown (Goodreads Author)The Boys in The BoatThe Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold at the 1936 Berlin OlympicsDaniel James Brown (Goodreads Author)The Boys in The Boat",English,"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Sports', 'Biography', 'Historical', 'Audiobook', 'Book Club', 'World War II', 'American History', 'Memoir']",404,Viking,June 4th 2013,222502,96.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1354683116l/16158542.jpg,readers laura hillenbrands seabiscuit unbroken dramatic story american rowing team stunned world hitlers berlin olympicsdaniel james browns robust book tells story university washingtons eightoar crew epic quest olympic gold medal team transformed sport grabbed attention millions americans sons loggers shipyard workers farmers boys defeated elite rivals first eastern british universities finally german crew rowing adolf hitler olympic games berlin emotional heart story lies one rower joe rantz teenager without family prospects rows glory regain shattered selfregard find place call home crew assembled enigmatic coach mentored visionary eccentric british boat builder trust makes victorious team remind country done everyone quite literally pulls togethera perfect melding commitment determination optimismdrawing boys diaries journals photos memories onceinalifetime shared dream boys boat irresistible story beating odds finding hope desperate timesthe improbable intimate story nine workingclass boys american west depths great depression showed world true grit really meant appeal readers erik larson timothy egan james bradley david halberstams amateursthe boys boat nine americans epic quest gold berlin olympicsdaniel james brown goodreads authorthe boys boatthe boys boat nine americans epic quest gold berlin olympicsdaniel james brown goodreads authorthe boys boat

We Should All Be Feminists,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,4.45,"What does “feminism” mean today? That is the question at the heart of We Should All Be Feminists, a personal, eloquently-argued essay—adapted from her much-viewed TEDx talk of the same name—by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, the award-winning author of Americanah and Half of a Yellow Sun. With humor and levity, here Adichie offers readers a unique definition of feminism for the twenty-first century—one rooted in inclusion and awareness. She shines a light not only on blatant discrimination, but also the more insidious, institutional behaviors that marginalize women around the world, in order to help readers of all walks of life better understand the often masked realities of sexual politics. Throughout, she draws extensively on her own experiences—in the U.S., in her native Nigeria, and abroad—offering an artfully nuanced explanation of why the gender divide is harmful for women and men, alike. Argued in the same observant, witty and clever prose that has made Adichie a bestselling novelist, here is one remarkable author’s exploration of what it means to be a woman today—and an of-the-moment rallying cry for why we should all be feminists.We Should All Be FeministsChimamanda Ngozi AdichieWe Should All Be FeministsChimamanda Ngozi Adichie",English,"['Nonfiction', 'Feminism', 'Essays', 'Audiobook', 'Politics', 'Womens', 'Africa', 'Social Justice', 'Adult', 'Gender']",52,Vintage,July 29th 2014,174513,98.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1430821222l/22738563.jpg,feminism mean today question heart feminists personal eloquentlyargued essayadapted muchviewed tedx talk nameby chimamanda ngozi adichie awardwinning author americanah half yellow sun humor levity adichie offers readers unique definition feminism twentyfirst centuryone rooted inclusion awareness shines light blatant discrimination also insidious institutional behaviors marginalize women around world order help readers walks life better understand often masked realities sexual politics throughout draws extensively experiencesin us native nigeria abroadoffering artfully nuanced explanation gender divide harmful women men alike argued observant witty clever prose made adichie bestselling novelist one remarkable authors exploration means woman todayand ofthemoment rallying cry feministswe feministschimamanda ngozi adichiewe feministschimamanda ngozi adichie
Small Great Things,Jodi Picoult (Goodreads Author),4.34,"Ruth Jefferson is a labor and delivery nurse at a Connecticut hospital with more than twenty years' experience. During her shift, Ruth begins a routine checkup on a newborn, only to be told a few minutes later that she's been reassigned to another patient. The parents are white supremacists and don't want Ruth, who is African American, to touch their child. The hospital complies with their request, but the next day, the baby goes into cardiac distress while Ruth is alone in the nursery. Does she obey orders or does she intervene? Ruth hesitates before performing CPR and, as a result, is charged with a serious crime. Kennedy McQuarrie, a white public defender, takes her case but gives unexpected advice: Kennedy insists that mentioning race in the courtroom is not a winning strategy. Conflicted by Kennedy's counsel, Ruth tries to keep life as normal as possible for her family—especially her teenage son—as the case becomes a media sensation. As the trial moves forward, Ruth and Kennedy must gain each other's trust, and come to see that what they've been taught their whole lives about others—and themselves—might be wrong. With incredible empathy, intelligence, and candor, Jodi Picoult tackles race, privilege, prejudice, justice, and compassion—and doesn't offer easy answers.

A tart-tongued mother does dead-on imitations of her young son's nervous tics, to the great amusement of his teachers; a stint of Kerouackian wandering is undertaken (of course!) with a quadriplegic companion; a family gathers for a wedding in the face of imminent death.

Norse Mythology,Neil Gaiman (Goodreads Author),4.08,"Neil Gaiman, long inspired by ancient mythology in creating the fantastical realms of his fiction, presents a bravura rendition of the Norse gods and their world from their origin though their upheaval in Ragnarok. In Norse Mythology, Gaiman stays true to the myths in envisioning the major Norse pantheon: Odin, the highest of the high, wise, daring, and cunning; Thor, Odin’s son, incredibly strong yet not the wisest of gods; and Loki—son of a giant—blood brother to Odin and a trickster and unsurpassable manipulator.Gaiman fashions these primeval stories into a novelistic arc that begins with the genesis of the legendary nine worlds and delves into the exploits of deities, dwarfs, and giants. Through Gaiman’s deft and witty prose, these gods emerge with their fiercely competitive natures, their susceptibility to being duped and to duping others, and their tendency to let passion ignite their actions, making these long-ago myths breathe pungent life again.Norse MythologyNeil Gaiman (Goodreads Author)Norse MythologyNeil Gaiman (Goodreads Author)",English,"['Fantasy', 'Mythology', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Short Stories', 'Classics', 'Adult', 'Historical Fiction', 'Retellings', 'Religion']",301,W.

Homegoing,Yaa Gyasi,4.44,"A novel of breathtaking sweep and emotional power that traces three hundred years in Ghana and along the way also becomes a truly great American novel. Extraordinary for its exquisite language, its implacable sorrow, its soaring beauty, and for its monumental portrait of the forces that shape families and nations, Homegoing heralds the arrival of a major new voice in contemporary fiction.Two half-sisters, Effia and Esi, are born into different villages in eighteenth-century Ghana. Effia is married off to an Englishman and lives in comfort in the palatial rooms of Cape Coast Castle. Unbeknownst to Effia, her sister, Esi, is imprisoned beneath her in the castle's dungeons, sold with thousands of others into the Gold Coast's booming slave trade, and shipped off to America, where her children and grandchildren will be raised in slavery. One thread of Homegoing follows Effia's descendants through centuries of warfare in Ghana, as the Fante and Asante nations wrestle with the slave trade and British colonization. The other thread follows Esi and her children into America. From the plantations of the South to the Civil War and the Great Migration, from the coal mines of Pratt City, Alabama, to the jazz clubs and dope houses of twentieth-century Harlem, right up through the present day, Homegoing makes history visceral, and captures, with singular and stunning immediacy, how the memory of captivity came to be inscribed in the soul of a nation. Generation after generation, Yaa Gyasi's magisterial first novel sets the fate of the individual against the obliterating movements of time, delivering unforgettable characters whose lives were shaped by historical forces beyond their control. Homegoing is a tremendous reading experience, not to be missed, by an astonishingly gifted young writer.HomegoingYaa GyasiHomegoingYaa Gyasi",English,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Africa', 'Historical', 'Literary Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Adult', 'Race', 'Adult Fiction', 'Ghana']",320,Alfred A.

1st to Die,James Patterson (Goodreads Author),4.08,"James Patterson, bestselling author of the Alex Cross novels Along Came a Spider, Kiss the Girls, and Pop Goes the Weasel, offers the first of a new series dubbed The Women's Murder Club, featuring a four-woman team that occasionally works outside the system. None of the gritty darkness or frenzied action is lost in 1st to Die, although the female protagonists offer an even deeper emotional context to this suspense thriller.Inspector Lindsay Boxer of the San Francisco Police Department suddenly finds herself in the middle of two horrifying situations: The first is that she's just learned she has an often-fatal blood disease. The second is a double homicide case she is now heading up that involves the murder of newlyweds on their wedding night. Burdened with Chris Raleigh, a new partner reassigned from the mayor's office, Lindsay finds that she has too much to deal with and turns to her best friend, Claire, the head ME on the case. Claire offers helpful advice and human, friendly contact amid a job filled with violence, cruelty, and fear.Soon a fledgling newspaper reporter, Cindy, makes contact with Lindsay looking for a career-making story. Although Lindsay can't officially comment on the case, the two women form a rapport, and Cindy joins Lindsay and Claire for their weekly meeting. When a second pair of newlyweds is murdered, and later a third, the investigation leads to a prominent crime writer, Nicholas Jenks, who has a history of spousal abuse and a predilection for kinky, dangerous sex games. With the help of an understanding assistant D.A., Jill Bernhardt, Lindsay tries to make a case against Jenks, who even had an affair with one of the slain women. Eventually Jill joins the Murder Club, and the four ladies share private interdepartmental information in an effort to track and stop the killer before he strikes again.The major subplot -- Lindsay's facing up to her illness even while she learns to fall in love again -- carefully compensates for the novel's coarse scenes of brutality. Lindsay Boxer is't merely an obsessed cop trailing a maniac; she's also a terrified woman confronting the onslaught of disease. The story lines balance out to show us the true mettle of someone who puts the safety of others before her own.Again, Patterson's skill for producing furiously paced fiction are evident as the novel breezes by rapidly. The short chapters keep the narrative leaping with increasingly taut plot elements, but there's an emotional commitment that makes our protagonist even more amiable and involving. 1st to Die is a novel that works as an intense series of character portraits that will leave the reader touched and delighted.--Tom Piccirilli1st to DieJames Patterson (Goodreads Author)Women's Murder Club #11st to DieJames Patterson (Goodreads Author)Women's Murder Club #1",English,"['Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Crime', 'Thriller', 'Suspense', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Murder Mystery', 'Audiobook', 'Detective', 'Adult']",424,Grand Central Publishing,May 20th 2005,296188,94.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1522906581l/13137._SY475_.jpg,james patterson bestselling author alex cross novels along came spider kiss girls pop goes weasel offers first new series dubbed womens murder club featuring fourwoman team occasionally works outside system none gritty darkness frenzied action lost st die although female protagonists offer even deeper emotional context suspense thrillerinspector lindsay boxer san francisco police department suddenly finds middle two horrifying situations first shes learned oftenfatal blood disease second double homicide case heading involves murder newlyweds wedding night burdened chris raleigh new partner reassigned mayors office lindsay finds much deal turns best friend claire head case claire offers helpful advice human friendly contact amid job filled violence cruelty fearsoon fledgling newspaper reporter cindy makes contact lindsay looking careermaking story although lindsay cant officially comment case two women form rapport cindy joins lindsay claire weekly meeting second pair newlyweds murdered later third investigation leads prominent crime writer nicholas jenks history spousal abuse predilection kinky dangerous sex games help understanding assistant da jill bernhardt lindsay tries make case jenks even affair one slain women eventually jill joins murder club four ladies share private interdepartmental information effort track stop killer strikes againthe major subplot lindsays facing illness even learns fall love carefully compensates novels coarse scenes brutality lindsay boxer ist merely obsessed cop trailing maniac shes also terrified woman confronting onslaught disease story lines balance show us true mettle someone puts safety others ownagain pattersons skill producing furiously paced fiction evident novel breezes rapidly short chapters keep narrative leaping increasingly taut plot elements theres emotional commitment makes protagonist even amiable involving st die novel works intense series character portraits leave reader touched delightedtom piccirillist diejames patterson goodreads authorwomens murder club st diejames patterson goodreads authorwomens murder club

The Underground Railroad,Colson Whitehead (Goodreads Author),4.03,"Cora is a slave on a cotton plantation in Georgia. Life is hell for all the slaves, but especially bad for Cora; an outcast even among her fellow Africans, she is coming into womanhood—where even greater pain awaits. When Caesar, a recent arrival from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they decide to take a terrifying risk and escape. Matters do not go as planned—Cora kills a young white boy who tries to capture her. Though they manage to find a station and head north, they are being hunted.In Whitehead’s ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor—engineers and conductors operate a secret network of tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora and Caesar’s first stop is South Carolina, in a city that initially seems like a haven. But the city’s placid surface masks an insidious scheme designed for its black denizens. And even worse: Ridgeway, the relentless slave catcher, is close on their heels. Forced to flee again, Cora embarks on a harrowing flight, state by state, seeking true freedom.Like the protagonist of Gulliver’s Travels, Cora encounters different worlds at each stage of her journey—hers is an odyssey through time as well as space. As Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the unique terrors for black people in the pre–Civil War era, his narrative seamlessly weaves the saga of America from the brutal importation of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day. The Underground Railroad is at once a kinetic adventure tale of one woman’s ferocious will to escape the horrors of bondage and a shattering, powerful meditation on the history we all share.The Underground RailroadColson Whitehead (Goodreads Author)The Underground RailroadColson Whitehead (Goodreads Author)",English,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Audiobook', 'Race', 'Literary Fiction', 'African American', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Novels']",306,Doubleday Books,August 2nd 2016,290126,94.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1493178362l/30555488.jpg,cora slave cotton plantation georgia life hell slaves especially bad cora outcast even among fellow africans coming womanhoodwhere even greater pain awaits caesar recent arrival virginia tells underground railroad decide take terrifying risk escape matters go plannedcora kills young white boy tries capture though manage find station head north huntedin whiteheads ingenious conception underground railroad mere metaphorengineers conductors operate secret network tracks tunnels beneath southern soil cora caesars first stop south carolina city initially seems like citys placid surface masks insidious scheme designed black denizens even worse ridgeway relentless slave catcher close heels forced flee cora embarks harrowing flight state state seeking true freedomlike protagonist gullivers travels cora encounters different worlds stage journeyhers odyssey time well space whitehead brilliantly recreates unique terrors black people precivil war era narrative seamlessly weaves saga america brutal importation africans unfulfilled promises present day underground railroad kinetic adventure tale one womans ferocious escape horrors bondage shattering powerful meditation history sharethe underground railroadcolson whitehead goodreads authorthe underground railroadcolson whitehead goodreads author
Under the Banner of Heaven,Jon Krakauer (Goodreads Author),4.0,"A Story of Violent FaithA multilayered, bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion, savage violence, polygamy, and unyielding faith. This is vintage Krakauer, an utterly compelling work of nonfiction that illuminates an otherwise confounding realm of human behavior.Jon Krakauer’s literary reputation rests on insightful chronicles of lives conducted at the outer limits. In Under The Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith, he shifts his focus from extremes of physical adventure to extremes of religious belief within our own borders. At the core of his book is an appalling double murder committed by two Mormon Fundamentalist brothers, Ron and Dan Lafferty, who insist they received a revelation from God commanding them to kill their blameless victims. Beginning with a meticulously researched account of this ""divinely inspired"" crime, Krakauer constructs a multilayered, bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion, savage violence, polygamy, and unyielding faith. Along the way, he uncovers a shadowy offshoot of America’s fastest-growing religion, and raises provocative questions about the nature of religious belief.Krakauer takes readers inside isolated communities in the American West, Canada, and Mexico, where some forty-thousand Mormon Fundamentalists believe the mainstream Mormon Church went unforgivably astray when it renounced polygamy. Defying both civil authorities and the Mormon establishment in Salt Lake City, the leaders of these outlaw sects are zealots who answer only to God. Marrying prodigiously and with virtual impunity (the leader of the largest fundamentalist church took seventy-five ""plural wives,"" several of whom were wed to him when they were fourteen or fifteen and he was in his eighties), fundamentalist prophets exercise absolute control over the lives of their followers, and preach that any day now the world will be swept clean in a hurricane of fire, sparing only their most obedient adherents.Weaving the story of the Lafferty brothers and their fanatical brethren with a clear-eyed look at Mormonism’s violent past, Krakauer examines the underbelly of the most successful homegrown faith in the United States, and finds a distinctly American brand of religious extremism. The result is vintage Krakauer, an utterly compelling work of nonfiction that illuminates an otherwise confounding realm of human behavior.Under the Banner of HeavenJon Krakauer (Goodreads Author)Under the Banner of HeavenJon Krakauer (Goodreads Author)",English,"['Nonfiction', 'Religion', 'History', 'True Crime', 'Crime', 'Audiobook', 'Biography', 'Book Club', 'Cults', 'Historical']",400,Pan MacMillan,2004,156956,94.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356441391l/10847.jpg,story violent faitha multilayered bonechilling narrative messianic delusion savage violence polygamy unyielding faith vintage krakauer utterly compelling work nonfiction illuminates otherwise confounding realm human behaviorjon krakauers literary reputation rests insightful chronicles lives conducted outer limits banner heaven story violent faith shifts focus extremes physical adventure extremes religious belief within borders core book appalling double murder committed two mormon fundamentalist brothers ron dan lafferty insist received revelation god commanding kill blameless victims beginning meticulously researched account divinely inspired crime krakauer constructs multilayered bonechilling narrative messianic delusion savage violence polygamy unyielding faith along way uncovers shadowy offshoot americas fastestgrowing religion raises provocative questions nature religious beliefkrakauer takes readers inside isolated communities american west canada mexico fortythousand mormon fundamentalists believe mainstream mormon church went unforgivably astray renounced polygamy defying civil authorities mormon establishment salt lake city leaders outlaw sects zealots answer god marrying prodigiously virtual impunity leader largest fundamentalist church took seventyfive plural wives several wed fourteen fifteen eighties fundamentalist prophets exercise absolute control lives followers preach day world swept clean hurricane fire sparing obedient adherentsweaving story lafferty brothers fanatical brethren cleareyed look mormonisms violent past krakauer examines underbelly successful homegrown faith united states finds distinctly american brand religious extremism result vintage krakauer utterly compelling work nonfiction illuminates otherwise confounding realm human behaviorunder banner heavenjon krakauer goodreads authorunder banner heavenjon krakauer goodreads author

"Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future","Peter Thiel, Blake Masters (Goodreads Author)",4.17,"If you want to build a better future, you must believe in secrets.The great secret of our time is that there are still uncharted frontiers to explore and new inventions to create. In Zero to One, legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things. Thiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we’re too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself.Doing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. Tomorrow’s champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today’s marketplace. They will escape competition altogether, because their businesses will be unique. Zero to One presents at once an optimistic view of the future of progress in America and a new way of thinking about innovation: it starts by learning to ask the questions that lead you to find value in unexpected places.Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the FuturePeter Thiel, Blake Masters (Goodreads Author)Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the FuturePeter Thiel, Blake Masters (Goodreads Author)",English,"['Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Economics', 'Self Help', 'Technology', 'Management', 'Leadership', 'Buisness', 'Finance']",195,Crown Business,September 16th 2014,189098,93.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1414347376l/18050143.jpg,want build better future must believe secretsthe great secret time still uncharted frontiers explore new inventions create zero one legendary entrepreneur investor peter thiel shows find singular ways create new things thiel begins contrarian premise live age technological stagnation even distracted shiny mobile devices notice information technology improved rapidly reason progress limited computers silicon valley progress achieved industry area business comes important skill every leader must master learning think yourselfdoing someone else already knows takes world n adding something familiar something new go next bill gates build operating system next larry page sergey brin wont make search engine tomorrows champions win competing ruthlessly todays marketplace escape competition altogether businesses unique zero one presents optimistic view future progress america new way thinking innovation starts learning ask questions lead find value unexpected placeszero one notes startups build futurepeter thiel blake masters goodreads authorzero one notes startups build futurepeter thiel blake masters goodreads author

Lilac Girls,Martha Hall Kelly (Goodreads Author),4.28,"Inspired by the life of a real World War II heroine, this debut novel reveals a story of love, redemption, and secrets that were hidden for decades. New York socialite Caroline Ferriday has her hands full with her post at the French consulate and a new love on the horizon. But Caroline’s world is forever changed when Hitler’s army invades Poland in September 1939—and then sets its sights on France.   An ocean away from Caroline, Kasia Kuzmerick, a Polish teenager, senses her carefree youth disappearing as she is drawn deeper into her role as courier for the underground resistance movement. In a tense atmosphere of watchful eyes and suspecting neighbors, one false move can have dire consequences.   For the ambitious young German doctor, Herta Oberheuser, an ad for a government medical position seems her ticket out of a desolate life. Once hired, though, she finds herself trapped in a male-dominated realm of Nazi secrets and power.   The lives of these three women are set on a collision course when the unthinkable happens and Kasia is sent to Ravensbrück, the notorious Nazi concentration camp for women. Their stories cross continents—from New York to Paris, Germany, and Poland—as Caroline and Kasia strive to bring justice to those whom history has forgotten.Lilac GirlsMartha Hall Kelly (Goodreads Author)Lilac Girls #1Lilac GirlsMartha Hall Kelly (Goodreads Author)Lilac Girls #1",English,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'World War II', 'Historical', 'War', 'Holocaust', 'Audiobook', 'Adult', 'Book Club', 'Adult Fiction']",487,Ballantine Books,April 5th 2016,213160,97.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1462850258l/25893693.jpg,inspired life real world war ii heroine debut novel reveals story love redemption secrets hidden decades new york socialite caroline ferriday hands full post french consulate new love horizon carolines world forever changed hitlers army invades poland september sets sights france ocean away caroline kasia kuzmerick polish teenager senses carefree youth disappearing drawn deeper role courier underground resistance movement tense atmosphere watchful eyes suspecting neighbors one false move dire consequences ambitious young german doctor herta oberheuser ad government medical position seems ticket desolate life hired though finds trapped maledominated realm nazi secrets power lives three women set collision course unthinkable happens kasia sent ravensbrck notorious nazi concentration camp women stories cross continentsfrom new york paris germany polandas caroline kasia strive bring justice history forgottenlilac girlsmartha hall kelly goodreads authorlilac girls lilac girlsmartha hall kelly goodreads authorlilac girls

I'll Be Gone in the Dark: One Woman's Obsessive Search for the Golden State Killer,"Michelle McNamara, Gillian Flynn (Goodreads Author) (Introduction), Patton Oswalt (Afterword)",4.12,"A masterful true crime account of the Golden State Killer—the elusive serial rapist turned murderer who terrorized California for over a decade—from Michelle McNamara, the gifted journalist who died tragically while investigating the case.""You’ll be silent forever, and I’ll be gone in the dark.""For more than ten years, a mysterious and violent predator committed fifty sexual assaults in Northern California before moving south, where he perpetrated ten sadistic murders. Then he disappeared, eluding capture by multiple police forces and some of the best detectives in the area.Three decades later, Michelle McNamara, a true crime journalist who created the popular website TrueCrimeDiary.com, was determined to find the violent psychopath she called ""the Golden State Killer."" Michelle pored over police reports, interviewed victims, and embedded herself in the online communities that were as obsessed with the case as she was.At the time of the crimes, the Golden State Killer was between the ages of eighteen and thirty, Caucasian, and athletic—capable of vaulting tall fences. He always wore a mask. After choosing a victim—he favored suburban couples—he often entered their home when no one was there, studying family pictures, mastering the layout. He attacked while they slept, using a flashlight to awaken and blind them. Though they could not recognize him, his victims recalled his voice: a guttural whisper through clenched teeth, abrupt and threatening.I’ll Be Gone in the Dark—the masterpiece McNamara was writing at the time of her sudden death—offers an atmospheric snapshot of a moment in American history and a chilling account of a criminal mastermind and the wreckage he left behind. It is also a portrait of a woman’s obsession and her unflagging pursuit of the truth. Framed by an introduction by Gillian Flynn and an afterword by her husband, Patton Oswalt, the book was completed by Michelle’s lead researcher and a close colleague. Utterly original and compelling, it is destined to become a true crime classic—and may at last unmask the Golden State Killer.I'll Be Gone in the Dark: One Woman's Obsessive Search for the Golden State KillerMichelle McNamara, Gillian Flynn (Goodreads Author) (Introduction), Patton Oswalt (Afterword)I'll Be Gone in the Dark: One Woman's Obsessive Search for the Golden State KillerMichelle McNamara, Gillian Flynn (Goodreads Author) (Introduction), Patton Oswalt (Afterword)",English,"['Nonfiction', 'True Crime', 'Crime', 'Audiobook', 'Mystery', 'History', 'Memoir', 'Adult', 'Thriller', 'Mystery Thriller']",352,Harper,February 27th 2018,155093,96.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1499131009l/35068432.jpg,masterful true crime account golden state killerthe elusive serial rapist turned murderer terrorized california decadefrom michelle mcnamara gifted journalist died tragically investigating caseyoull silent forever ill gone darkfor ten years mysterious violent predator committed fifty sexual assaults northern california moving south perpetrated ten sadistic murders disappeared eluding capture multiple police forces best detectives areathree decades later michelle mcnamara true crime journalist created popular website truecrimediarycom determined find violent psychopath called golden state killer michelle pored police reports interviewed victims embedded online communities obsessed case wasat time crimes golden state killer ages eighteen thirty caucasian athleticcapable vaulting tall fences always wore mask choosing victimhe favored suburban coupleshe often entered home one studying family pictures mastering layout attacked slept using flashlight awaken blind though could recognize victims recalled voice guttural whisper clenched teeth abrupt threateningill gone darkthe masterpiece mcnamara writing time sudden deathoffers atmospheric snapshot moment american history chilling account criminal mastermind wreckage left behind also portrait womans obsession unflagging pursuit truth framed introduction gillian flynn afterword husband patton oswalt book completed michelles lead researcher close colleague utterly original compelling destined become true crime classicand may last unmask golden state killerill gone dark one womans obsessive search golden state killermichelle mcnamara gillian flynn goodreads author introduction patton oswalt afterwordill gone dark one womans obsessive search golden state killermichelle mcnamara gillian flynn goodreads author introduction patton oswalt afterword

Backed by investors such as Larry Ellison and Tim Draper, Theranos sold shares in a fundraising round that valued the company at $9 billion, putting Holmes's worth at an estimated $4.7 billion. There was just one problem: The technology didn't work.For years, Holmes had been misleading investors, FDA officials, and her own employees. When Carreyrou, working at The Wall Street Journal, got a tip from a former Theranos employee and started asking questions, both Carreyrou and the Journal were threatened with lawsuits. Undaunted, the newspaper ran the first of dozens of Theranos articles in late 2015.

Corduroy,Don Freeman,4.3,"Have you ever dreamed of being locked in a department store at night? The endearing story of Corduroy paints a picture of the adventures that might unfold (for a teddy bear at least) in such a situation. When all the shoppers have gone home for the night, Corduroy climbs down from the shelf to look for his missing button. It's a brave new world! He accidentally gets on an elevator that he thinks must be a mountain and sees the furniture section that he thinks must be a palace.

American Dirt,Jeanine Cummins (Goodreads Author),4.31,"También de este lado hay sueños. On this side, too, there are dreams.Lydia Quixano Pérez lives in the Mexican city of Acapulco. She runs a bookstore. She has a son, Luca, the love of her life, and a wonderful husband who is a journalist. And while there are cracks beginning to show in Acapulco because of the drug cartels, her life is, by and large, fairly comfortable.Even though she knows they’ll never sell, Lydia stocks some of her all-time favorite books in her store. And then one day a man enters the shop to browse and comes up to the register with a few books he would like to buy—two of them her favorites. Javier is erudite. He is charming. And, unbeknownst to Lydia, he is the jefe of the newest drug cartel that has gruesomely taken over the city. When Lydia’s husband’s tell-all profile of Javier is published, none of their lives will ever be the same.Forced to flee, Lydia and eight-year-old Luca soon find themselves miles and worlds away from their comfortable middle-class existence. Instantly transformed into migrants, Lydia and Luca ride la bestia—trains that make their way north toward the United States, which is the only place Javier’s reach doesn’t extend. As they join the countless people trying to reach el norte, Lydia soon sees that everyone is running from something.

The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses,Eric Ries (Goodreads Author),4.09,"Most startups fail. But many of those failures are preventable. The Lean Startup is a new approach being adopted across the globe, changing the way companies are built and new products are launched. Eric Ries defines a startup as an organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty. This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful path to a sustainable business.The Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively. Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on ""validated learning,"" rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions with agility, altering plans inch by inch, minute by minute.Rather than wasting time creating elaborate business plans, The Lean Startup offers entrepreneurs - in companies of all sizes - a way to test their vision continuously, to adapt and adjust before it's too late. Ries provides a scientific approach to creating and managing successful startups in a age when companies need to innovate more than ever.The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful BusinessesEric Ries (Goodreads Author)The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful BusinessesEric Ries (Goodreads Author)",English,"['Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Management', 'Buisness', 'Leadership', 'Technology', 'Self Help', 'Economics', 'Productivity']",299,Currency,September 13th 2011,235463,92.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1333576876l/10127019.jpg,startups fail many failures preventable lean startup new approach adopted across globe changing way companies built new products launched eric ries defines startup organization dedicated creating something new conditions extreme uncertainty true one person garage group seasoned professionals fortune boardroom common mission penetrate fog uncertainty discover successful path sustainable businessthe lean startup approach fosters companies capital efficient leverage human creativity effectively inspired lessons lean manufacturing relies validated learning rapid scientific experimentation well number counterintuitive practices shorten product development cycles measure actual progress without resorting vanity metrics learn customers really want enables company shift directions agility altering plans inch inch minute minuterather wasting time creating elaborate business plans lean startup offers entrepreneurs companies sizes way test vision continuously adapt adjust late ries provides scientific approach creating managing successful startups age companies need innovate everthe lean startup todays entrepreneurs use continuous innovation create radically successful businesseseric ries goodreads authorthe lean startup todays entrepreneurs use continuous innovation create radically successful businesseseric ries goodreads author

The Way of Kings,Brandon Sanderson (Goodreads Author),4.63,"I long for the days before the Last Desolation. Before the Heralds abandoned us and the Knights Radiant turned against us. When there was still magic in Roshar and honor in the hearts of men.In the end, not war but victory proved the greater test. Did our foes see that the harder they fought, the fiercer our resistance? Fire and hammer forge a sword; time and neglect rust it away. So we won the world, yet lost it.Now there are four whom we watch: the surgeon, forced to forsake healing and fight in the most brutal war of our time; the assassin, who weeps as he kills; the liar, who wears her scholar's mantle over a thief's heart; and the prince, whose eyes open to the ancient past as his thirst for battle wanes.

The Giver of Stars,Jojo Moyes (Goodreads Author),4.28,"From the author of Me Before You, set in Depression-era America, a breathtaking story of five extraordinary women and their remarkable journey through the mountains of Kentucky and beyond.Alice Wright marries handsome American Bennett Van Cleve hoping to escape her stifling life in England. But small-town Kentucky quickly proves equally claustrophobic, especially living alongside her overbearing father-in-law. So when a call goes out for a team of women to deliver books as part of Eleanor Roosevelt’s new traveling library, Alice signs on enthusiastically.The leader, and soon Alice’s greatest ally, is Margery, a smart-talking, self-sufficient woman who’s never asked a man’s permission for anything. They will be joined by three other singular women who become known as the Packhorse Librarians of Kentucky. What happens to them–and to the men they love–becomes an unforgettable drama of loyalty, justice, humanity and passion. These heroic women refuse to be cowed by men or by convention. And though they face all kinds of dangers in a landscape that is at times breathtakingly beautiful, at others brutal, they’re committed to their job: bringing books to people who have never had any, arming them with facts that will change their lives.Based on a true story rooted in America’s past, The Giver of Stars is unparalleled in its scope and epic in its storytelling. Funny, heartbreaking, enthralling, it is destined to become a modern classic–a richly rewarding novel of women’s friendship, of true love, and of what happens when we reach beyond our grasp for the great beyond.The Giver of StarsJojo Moyes (Goodreads Author)The Giver of StarsJojo Moyes (Goodreads Author)",English,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Historical', 'Romance', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Book Club', 'Books About Books', 'Chick Lit']",388,Pamela Dorman Books,October 8th 2019,183231,97.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1572879113l/43925876._SX318_.jpg,author set depressionera america breathtaking story five extraordinary women remarkable journey mountains kentucky beyondalice wright marries handsome american bennett van cleve hoping escape stifling life england smalltown kentucky quickly proves equally claustrophobic especially living alongside overbearing fatherinlaw call goes team women deliver books part eleanor roosevelts new traveling library alice signs enthusiasticallythe leader soon alices greatest ally margery smarttalking selfsufficient woman whos never asked mans permission anything joined three singular women become known packhorse librarians kentucky happens themand men lovebecomes unforgettable drama loyalty justice humanity passion heroic women refuse cowed men convention though face kinds dangers landscape times breathtakingly beautiful others brutal theyre committed job bringing books people never arming facts change livesbased true story rooted americas past giver stars unparalleled scope epic storytelling funny heartbreaking enthralling destined become modern classica richly rewarding novel womens friendship true love happens reach beyond grasp great beyondthe giver starsjojo moyes goodreads authorthe giver starsjojo moyes goodreads author
City of Girls,Elizabeth Gilbert (Goodreads Author),4.04,"""Life is both fleeting and dangerous, and there is no point in denying yourself pleasure, or being anything other than what you are.""Beloved author Elizabeth Gilbert returns to fiction with a unique love story set in the New York City theater world during the 1940s. Told from the perspective of an older woman as she looks back on her youth with both pleasure and regret (but mostly pleasure), City of Girls explores themes of female sexuality and promiscuity, as well as the idiosyncrasies of true love.In 1940, nineteen-year-old Vivian Morris has just been kicked out of Vassar College, owing to her lackluster freshman-year performance. Her affluent parents send her to Manhattan to live with her Aunt Peg, who owns a flamboyant, crumbling midtown theater called the Lily Playhouse. There Vivian is introduced to an entire cosmos of unconventional and charismatic characters, from the fun-chasing showgirls to a sexy male actor, a grand-dame actress, a lady-killer writer, and no-nonsense stage manager. But when Vivian makes a personal mistake that results in professional scandal, it turns her new world upside down in ways that it will take her years to fully understand. Ultimately, though, it leads her to a new understanding of the kind of life she craves - and the kind of freedom it takes to pursue it. It will also lead to the love of her life, a love that stands out from all the rest.Now ninety-five years old and telling her story at last, Vivian recalls how the events of those years altered the course of her life - and the gusto and autonomy with which she approached it. ""At some point in a woman's life, she just gets tired of being ashamed all the time,"" she muses. ""After that, she is free to become whoever she truly is."" Written with a powerful wisdom about human desire and connection, City of Girls is a love story like no other.City of GirlsElizabeth Gilbert (Goodreads Author)City of GirlsElizabeth Gilbert (Goodreads Author)",English,"['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Audiobook', 'Historical', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Romance', 'Book Club', 'Contemporary', 'Novels']",496,Riverhead Books,April 7th 2020,157326,95.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1583203648l/51918871.jpg,life fleeting dangerous point denying pleasure anything arebeloved author elizabeth gilbert returns fiction unique love story set new york city theater world told perspective older woman looks back youth pleasure regret mostly pleasure city girls explores themes female sexuality promiscuity well idiosyncrasies true lovein nineteenyearold vivian morris kicked vassar college owing lackluster freshmanyear performance affluent parents send manhattan live aunt peg owns flamboyant crumbling midtown theater called lily playhouse vivian introduced entire cosmos unconventional charismatic characters funchasing showgirls sexy male actor granddame actress ladykiller writer nononsense stage manager vivian makes personal mistake results professional scandal turns new world upside ways take years fully understand ultimately though leads new understanding kind life craves kind freedom takes pursue also lead love life love stands restnow ninetyfive years old telling story last vivian recalls events years altered course life gusto autonomy approached point womans life gets tired ashamed time muses free become whoever truly written powerful wisdom human desire connection city girls love story like othercity girlselizabeth gilbert goodreads authorcity girlselizabeth gilbert goodreads author
The Way of Kings,Brandon Sanderson (Goodreads Author),4.63,"From #1 New York Times bestselling author Brandon Sanderson, The Way of Kings, Book One of the Stormlight Archive begins an incredible new saga of epic proportion.Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them.One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.Speak again the ancient oaths:Life before death.Strength before weakness.Journey before Destination.and return to men the Shards they once bore.The Knights Radiant must stand again.The Way of KingsBrandon Sanderson (Goodreads Author)The Stormlight Archive #1The Way of KingsBrandon Sanderson (Goodreads Author)The Stormlight Archive #1",English,"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Epic Fantasy', 'High Fantasy', 'Audiobook', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Adult', 'Epic', 'Magic', 'Adventure']",1137,Tor Books,August 31st 2010,304529,98.0,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1296253603l/9188338._SY475_.jpg,new york times bestselling author brandon sanderson way kings book one stormlight archive begins incredible new saga epic proportionroshar world stone storms uncanny tempests incredible power sweep across rocky terrain frequently shaped ecology civilization alike animals hide shells trees pull branches grass retracts soilless ground cities built topography offers shelterit centuries since fall ten consecrated orders known knights radiant shardblades shardplate remain mystical swords suits armor transform ordinary men nearinvincible warriors men trade kingdoms shardblades wars fought themone war rages ruined landscape called shattered plains kaladin traded medical apprenticeship spear protect little brother reduced slavery war makes sense ten armies fight separately single foe struggles save men fathom leaders consider expendablebrightlord dalinar kholin commands one armies like brother late king fascinated ancient text called way kings troubled overpowering visions ancient times knights radiant begun doubt sanityacross ocean untried young woman named shallan seeks train eminent scholar notorious heretic dalinars niece jasnah though genuinely loves learning shallans motives less pure plans daring theft research jasnah hints secrets knights radiant true cause warthe result ten years planning writing worldbuilding way kings opening movement stormlight archive bold masterpiece makingspeak ancient oathslife deathstrength weaknessjourney destinationand return men shards borethe knights radiant must stand againthe way kingsbrandon sanderson goodreads authorthe stormlight archive way kingsbrandon sanderson goodreads authorthe stormlight archive
